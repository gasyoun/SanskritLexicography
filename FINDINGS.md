# FINDINGS — cross-repo empirical registry

Non-obvious, **evidence-backed** facts about the Sanskrit-lexicon data, corpus, dictionary
structure, encoding, and tooling — the kind of thing that is expensive to re-discover and
easy to get wrong by assumption. Distinct from [`PILOT_LESSONS.md`](../PILOT_LESSONS.md)
(CI/CD process) and [`SHARED_CODE.md`](../SHARED_CODE.md) (who-owns-what code).

> **Living document — appended on a regular basis.** Every session that *measures* a
> non-obvious fact (a probe result, a count, a structural gotcha) adds it here, same pass as
> the work that found it. If you discovered it by running something, it belongs here.

**Schema per finding:** a one-line **claim** in bold, then `Evidence:` (the measurement, with
numbers / a file + line), `Implication:` (what to do or not do), and a **Source** link to the
exact statement and/or code, with a `— repo · date` tag. Keep them grounded (a number, a file,
a probe), never a hunch. When a finding is later refuted or superseded, strike it and say why.

## Grammar & morphology data

- **Whitney's Grammar already carries machine-encodable per-case ACCENT-MOBILITY rules — the
  blocker to a Zaliznyak a–f accent axis is encoding, not a missing source.**
  Evidence: the ingested `WhitneyRoots/src/whitney_sections.json` declension chapters (IV–V) hold
  28 sections with concrete accent rules — §§315–317 ("the accent falls upon the ending in all the
  weak cases": `nāvā́, vācí, vākṣú`), §318 (participles -ánt shift only in the *weakest*: `tudatā́`
  vs `tudátsu`), §319 (accented-short-vowel polysyllables *retain*: `agnínā, agnáye`), plus per-class
  §350/§372/§390/§423/§446 and §314 (vocative→first syllable). These are exactly Zaliznyak's a–f
  schemes, conditioned on the lemma's accent POSITION — which PWG already supplies via the udātta `/`
  in `key2` (`agni/`=agní, `se/nA`=sénā).
  Implication: a full Vedic accent-mobility axis is an extraction task (hand-encode ~10 rules into a
  (stem-class, accent-position)→case-accent table, join with `key2` `/`, validate vs accented RV),
  NOT a data-acquisition blocker. Vedic-only (Classical entries have no `/`). Earlier claim that
  "Whitney might supply it but our data can't" was an overstatement — both halves are on disk.
  **Validation set = VedaWeb 2.0, PROBED + CONFIRMED 2026-06-29.** API live at
  `vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/api` (FastAPI, OpenAPI at `/api/openapi.json`).
  `POST /api/search {"type":"quick","q":"agni"}` → 3,840 hits; e.g. RV 6.59.3 highlight from the
  **Casaretto et al. (2025) annotation resource** `66695e4a14f6d337f7788740` is the udātta-marked
  word-split `… índrā; nú; agnī́; ávasā; ihá; vajríṇā; vayám; devā́` — accented per-word forms,
  position-aligned, with lemmatization (`679b7da2…`) + accented text (`66695c4b…`, Scarlata–Widmer/
  Lubotsky) at the same locations, and bulk `GET /api/resources/{id}/export`. So per lemma you can
  collect attested inflected+accented forms, bucket by morphology, and validate a generated paradigm.
  **CC BY 4.0**, in-ecosystem (C-SALT/CDSL). The accent axis is *unblocked and de-risked* — only the
  Whitney-rule encoding + the join remain. (The legacy `/rigveda/api/search` is superseded by 2.0.)

## Corpus & parallel-text data

- **The parallel corpus rarely attests prefixed-verb surface forms.**
  Evidence: of √man's 15 prefixed forms, only **3** (`anuman`, `abhiman`, `avaman`) appear in
  the SamudraManthanam parallel corpus; the `pwg_preverb1.txt` sandhi-join produces the *same*
  surface strings as a naïve `upasarga+root` concat, so spelling is not the limiter — the
  corpus simply lemmatises prefixed verbs to the root or lacks them.
  Implication: prefix-specific Apresjan evidence is corpus-bound; for the ~80 % that miss,
  defer to the dictionary's own (German) gloss. Do **not** build a sandhi-join lookup
  expecting coverage gains — it's a no-op.

- **No printed frequency dictionary of Sanskrit exists.**
  Evidence: absent from the prefaces and literature of PWG/PW/MW/GRA/AP90 and from Kochergina;
  only Hellwig's DCS corpus counts (≈2021) give per-lemma frequency.
  Implication: DCS-frequency headword ordering is a genuine innovation, not a digitisation of
  prior art.

- **DCS lemma data is keyed in two different transliterations.**
  Evidence: `VisualDCS/dcs_lemma_summary.json` (`lemmas`, freqBand 1–5) is **SLP1**-keyed
  (joins PWG `key1` natively); `RussianTranslation/src/dcs_lemma_renou.json` (breadth `n_texts`,
  dates) is **IAST**-keyed.
  Implication: a freq join must transcode SLP1↔IAST for the second; don't assume one scheme.

- **The unaccented DCS corpus cannot distinguish present class I from VI (or IV from passive).**
  Evidence: WhitneyRoots — the corpus carries no pitch accent, and the class distinction rests
  on it.
  Implication: never write a corpus-derived verb class into reviewed data without a grammar /
  Zaliznyak cross-check.

## Dictionary structure & markup

- **PWG never uses `<div n="m">`; secondary stems are encoded inline.**
  Evidence: 0 occurrences of `<div n="m">` in `csl-orig/v02/pwg/pwg.txt`; causative/desiderative/
  intensive/participle/passive of the simple root appear as `<div n="p">— <ab>caus.</ab> {#…#}`
  (a `<div n="p">` whose first token is an `<ab>` label, not a `{#upasarga#}`).
  Implication: a secondary-stem segmenter keys on the inline `<ab>` label
  (`SEC_DIVP_RE` + a caus/desid/intens/partic/pass/insens label set), not on `<div n="m">`.
  **Source:** code [`SEC_DIVP_RE` + the comment](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/blob/master/RussianTranslation/research/root_segment_proto.py#L28-L34)
  · measured by [`verify_root_glue.py`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/blob/master/RussianTranslation/src/verify_root_glue.py) (570 split, 0 merged). — csl-orig (pwg) / RussianTranslation · 2026-06-24

- **A headword's giant verb root often sits at a non-zero homonym index.**
  Evidence: √i has its 114-prefix verb root at homonym **2** (homonym 0 is the particle);
  √mā at index 2, √As at index 1; 19 of the top-50 freq roots have a giant homonym at
  index > 0 or more than one giant homonym.
  Implication: any per-record split / processing must iterate **all** homonym records, not
  `bufs[0]`, or it silently misses the verb (or drops extra giant homonyms).

- **PWG orders senses genetically (etymological core first), not historically.**
  Evidence: across 13,900 multi-sense entries, printed sense-1 is the oldest-attested only
  **73.5 %** of the time; Kendall τ(printed vs date) = **0.375**; citations *within* a sense run
  old→new in 76 % of adjacent pairs but are strictly sorted in only 26 %.
  Implication: don't auto-re-sort senses by date or frequency (it changes the lead sense for
  ~1 in 4 entries and fights the source); surface attestation era as per-sense metadata instead.

- **Vedic-citation density cleanly separates the dictionary traditions.**
  Evidence: fraction of cited senses reaching a Vedic source — **PWG 23.4 % ≈ MW 24.8 % ≫
  AP90 2.3 % ≫ Kochergina 0 %**.
  Implication: PWG/MW are etymological-genetic with a real historical apparatus; Apte and
  Kochergina are logical-semantic / pedagogical — do not import their sense order into a PWG
  translation.

- **SKD and VCP carry essentially zero Western markup.**
  Evidence: ~0 `<ab>`/`<div>`/`<s>`/`<ls>` tags; citations appear via `iti`/quotes, verbs via
  `dhātuḥ`/`preraṇe`/`bhvādi`.
  Implication: any marker-based detector scores SKD/VCP at 0 *by construction* — never read 0
  as "no content"; use the indigenous cues. (Miscalled ≥4×.)

- **`ls_source_map.json` recognises 72.4 % of PWG's `<ls>` citations.**
  Evidence: 559,243 of 772,567 `<ls>` keys map to one of 45 dated primary sources
  (range −1125 → 1830); the unrecognised 27.6 % is catalogues / secondary literature
  (Aufrecht's Oxford catalogue, *Indische Studien*, *Indische Sprüche*), which skews *late*.
  Implication: dated-citation analyses see the most-cited primary corpus and are conservative
  about the oldest stratum, not biased toward it.

- **MW has no sense-level `<div>`; the sense unit is the record itself.**
  Evidence: `csl-orig/v02/mw/mw.txt` carries **0** `<div n="m">` and only **4** `<div n="p">` across
  **286,526** `<L>` records — MW essentially never subdivides an entry by sense in markup (senses are
  separated by `¦` inside the single record body).
  Implication: a sense-segmenter for MW must split on `¦` inside the record, not on `<div>`; and do
  **not** template MW's flat structure onto subentry-rich dicts (PWG/Apte) or vice-versa — `<div>` depth
  is structural, not a sense boundary, so it over-counts senses.
  **Source:** measured `grep -c '<div n="m"' / '<L>'` on

- **"Apte" is three distinct dictionaries, and the same lemma keys differently across dicts (stem vs nominative).**
  Evidence: AP90 (Apte 1890), AP (Apte Revised 1957–59), and AE/ApteES (reverse English→Sanskrit Apte)
  are separate `csl-orig` dicts with different markup (AP90 uses `∙²` sense markers, numeric `<pc>0002-1`
  page-cols, `{%<lex>a.</lex>%}` labels). The same headword also keys differently *between* dictionaries —
  MW stores the bare stem `agni`, Apte the nominative `agniH` — so a cross-dict join on the raw key
  silently misses matches (independently re-hit in csl-guides and csl-apidev).
  Implication: never treat "Apte" as one source — pick AP90 / AP / AE explicitly. For any cross-dict
  headword join, normalise stem↔nominative and join on the `key1` computational key, not `key2`/printed form.
  **Source:** csl-guides/.ai_state.md + csl-apidev/.ai_state.md (the `agni`/`agniH` resolver note); markup per

- **~9 % of "typo" headword corrections in the early dictionaries are really COLLISIONS — the
  correct spelling already exists as its own separate entry, so a `<k1>` respell would create a
  duplicate headword or clobber apparatus, not fix a typo.**
  Evidence: source-verification of all 122 SanskritSpellCheck FILE-FIRST candidates vs `csl-orig`
  (02-07-2026): 11/122 are dual-listings — YAT 5 (wrong+right both attested, often cross-referenced
  "Idem": `vizwABU/vizWABU` even share an identical gloss 10 L-ids apart), MW 2 (`kattfRa` already
  exists at L42680 beside `kattfna`; `Bawwaraka` short-a is an `L.`-sourced lexicographers' variant),
  PWG 2 (the `duzWu` "entry" is an errata note about an *unrelated* correction; `pfzwavanDu`/`pfzwabanDu`
  both independently glossed), PW 1 (`*hemana` is Böhtlingk's own `*`-marked constructed form). Plus
  1 more (`YAT RiS`) is Dhātupāṭha ṇopadeśa root notation, not a typo. Full verdicts:
  [`file_first_verified.tsv`](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/blob/master/corrections_draft/file_first_verified.tsv).
  Implication: never bulk-respell a headword-correction list — a filing must offer a third,
  *editorial* category (merge vs respell vs leave) for collision pairs; check whether the "right"
  form already exists as its own entry before proposing any respell.

- **A verified correction queue DECAYS against the live `csl-orig` — upstream fixes land between
  triage and filing.**
  Evidence: 1 of 122 FILE-FIRST candidates (`SHS kARqapfzwa→kARqapfzWa`, triaged June 2026) was
  already fixed upstream by 02-07-2026 — the correct form exists as its own entry (id 9855), the
  wrong form is gone. ~1 week of queue age ≈ 0.8 % decay on this batch.
  Implication: re-verify every candidate against the current `csl-orig` immediately before filing
  or applying; a stale row filed upstream reads as bot noise to the maintainers.

## Encoding & normalization

- **IAST Unicode collides and lossily normalises if you're naïve.**
  Evidence: `ś` = `s` + U+0301 (combining acute), which collides with a pitch-accent mark;
  NFD-decompose-then-strip-Mn destroys vowel length (`ā`→`a`) and retroflex dots (`ṣ`→`s`).
  Implication: use a length-preserving `form_key`, not a blanket NFD+strip-combining.

- **`csl-orig` files never carry a BOM; many exported HeadwordLists do.**
  Evidence: `csl-orig` dict `.txt` are BOM-free; e.g. `MW-unique-key1-…txt` **has** `EF BB BF`
  while its `key2` sibling does not.
  Implication: check `head -c 3` before transforming; preserve the file's existing BOM state on
  write; never silently add/strip one.

- **`devanagari_to_slp1` mis-routes ळ (ḷa).**
  Evidence: a pre-existing `sanskrit-util` master bug routes ळ via IAST→`x` instead of `L`.
  Implication: low-severity (affects `ocr_verify`), but don't trust ḷa round-trips until fixed
  (fix in progress on branch `feat/deva-to-slp1`).

## Tooling & infra

- **CodeQL has no PHP analyzer.**
  Evidence: an `Analyze (php)` matrix job is a permanent red across the org; PHP is absent from
  CodeQL's supported languages.
  Implication: scan PHP with Semgrep instead; keep `php` out of any CodeQL language matrix.
  **Source:** [GitHub CodeQL — supported languages](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) (PHP not listed). — org-wide · 2026-06

- **The indigenous Sanskrit dictionaries agree on a head-word's derivation 90–100 %; Wilson 1832 is the systematic outlier (23–61 %).**
  Evidence: across 10 Cologne dicts whose etymology was extracted to `<dict>_etymology.tsv`, affix
  agreement on shared head-words (proportion, 95 % Wilson CI) is SKD↔VCP 93.8 % [85.2–97.6], Apte↔AP
  100 % [97.9–100], VCP↔SHS 98.5 % [95.8–99.5], but WIL↔SKD only **22.9 % [14.6–34.0]** and WIL↔VCP
  **61.2 % [58.7–63.7]** — the Wilson interval (≤34 %) is **disjoint** from every Sanskrit-side pair
  (≥83 %), so the divergence is statistically clear, not sampling noise. Cross-tradition root
  attribution: MW↔PWG (English √ vs German "Wurzel") 65 %, PWG↔PW 93 %.
  Implication: the Pāṇinian analysis is a stable cross-source signal usable as a consensus/QA oracle;
  Wilson's divergence is a distinct stratum, not noise.

- **The same `<ab>E.</ab>` tag means different things across dicts — count the meaning, not the marker.**
  Evidence: WIL `E.` = Etymology (39,713×); but CAE `E.` = "Epithet of" (`E. of Śiva/Viṣṇu/Indra`,
  584×) and MD `E.` = "Epic" (`āste (E. + I. Ā.)`). A tag-count survey wrongly flagged CAE/MD as
  etymology sources; reading the entry contexts corrected it.
  Implication: never infer content from a shared tag across dicts (generalises the SKD/VCP
  zero-markup trap); validate a marker's *sense* per dictionary before parsing it.
  **Source:** `csl-orig/v02/{cae,md}/` entry contexts — csl-orig · 2026-06-26

- **Inferred root-recovery tiers err on root FORM, not root identity — and an LLM root pass must be dhātu-validated.**
  Evidence: a DeepSeek-judged audit of the etymology extractor's inferred tiers gives nearest-root ≈ 69 %,
  oracle-join ≈ 74 % root precision, but most "misses" are a correct root in a stem rather than citation
  form (`sada` for `sad`, `kṝ` for `kṛ`) — true identity-precision is higher. A DeepSeek `resolve` pass over
  the residual empties (VCP 87→97 %, SHS 59→95 %) only writes a root that validates against the canonical
  dhātu list, so hallucinated non-dhātu roots are discarded, not stored.
  Implication: when filling roots by inference or LLM, (1) normalize to dhātupāṭha citation form before
  comparing/joining, and (2) always gate an LLM-proposed root through a known-dhātu set — never trust it raw.
  Resolved by a `build_root_normalization.py` pass (CANON = `mw_roots.tsv` citation forms ONLY — vidyut's
  surface forms keep the thematic `-a` and must NOT seed CANON): 622 variants folded (`sada`→`sad`),
  guarded so a real distinct root (`kṝ` ≠ `kṛ`) is never collapsed; oracle-join precision then rose 74→83 %,
  nearest-root stays the weakest tier (~66–75 %, genuine wrong-token grabs) and is tagged for downweighting.
