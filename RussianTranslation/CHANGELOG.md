# pwg_ru — changelog

How the Russian edition of the Petersburg Dictionary (PWG, Böhtlingk–Roth)
evolved. Newest first. This is the *project* changelog (method + pipeline); the
data stores are gitignored and versioned by their build provenance.

See also: [METHODOLOGY_REVIEW.md](METHODOLOGY_REVIEW.md) (where we want to go),
[failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md](failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md) (what went wrong and
how it got better), [APRESJAN.md](APRESJAN.md) (the theory we build on).

## 2026-06-27

### Token optimization for the Max bulk run — "weeks not days" (BALANCED tier)
- New [TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_2026-06-27.md](TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_2026-06-27.md): measured the real
  quota driver and re-architected the bulk run so a single Max seat sustains weeks of work
  instead of burning out in 3–4 days. **Finding 1** — the cost is `cache_read ≈ context × turns`,
  not prompt size; **Finding 2** — the multiplier is *assistant turns*, driven by agents
  re-`Read`ing `raw.txt`/`portrait.json` 4–12× per card. One giant root at the old config ≈
  **9–10 M tokens**.
- **A/B measured (tyaj baseline vs optimized):** agents 28→14, turns 138→47, Read calls 60→19
  (**3.2×**), `cache_read` 2.74 M→0.85 M (**3.2×**), wall-clock 6.6→2.5 min, transient failures
  3→**0**. Net ~2× on the headline metric, ~3.2× on the real driver.
- **QA reshape — "Python at max, LLM at minimum."** The LLM judge's only irreplaceable job is
  catching *mistranslation*; everything mechanical is now free and 100%-coverage in Python. New
  gate [src/audit_coverage.py](src/audit_coverage.py) catches silently dropped/fabricated senses
  (COVERAGE-LOW <80% / COVERAGE-OVER >150%, NWS/supplement cards n/a). Per-card LLM judge dropped
  → free gates (`audit_translation.py` markup + `audit_coverage.py` senses + `nws_split.py` owner
  map) on every card, LLM judge only on Python-gate flags + a ~5–10% mistranslation sample.
- **Gate false-positive guard.** Both free gates got an absolute-difference floor so a ±1
  span/sense gap on a 1–4-span card no longer false-flags, while the giant-head citation dump
  (e.g. 7/125) still trips: [src/audit_translation.py](src/audit_translation.py) needs ≥2 absolute
  `<ls>`/`{#}` loss in addition to the 90/85% ratio; `audit_coverage.py` uses `(raw−card)≥2` /
  `(card−raw)≥3`.
- **Head lane — sense-aware Python split (Finding 5).** Giant HEAD cards (`*_pwg00`, ~1 per root)
  overflow a single pass and shed their citation apparatus. New `sense_chunks()` in
  [src/_pilot_gen_merged.py](src/_pilot_gen_merged.py) splits the head at `<div n=…>` SENSE
  boundaries (not line count), grouping senses until their combined `<ls>` count exceeds
  `HEAD_CIT_BUDGET` (=18) so each part is citation-light and flows through the cheap single-turn
  lane. tyaj head: 1 dense 146-`<ls>` blob → 8 sense-parts; whole root 19 sub-cards (15 single-turn
  / 4 multi-turn). The multi-turn no-abridge lane survives only as the rare fallback for a lone
  over-budget sense.
- **Reliability.** Optimized harness adds 1 automatic retry per stage + a post-run missing-key
  re-queue (Finding 4: ~10–20% transient `Connection closed mid-response` rate across gam/tyaj).
- **Decision (M.G.):** BALANCED tier adopted — single-turn inlined inputs + free Python gates +
  sampled judge. Open headroom: restrict the Read tool to force true single-turn (residual 19
  reads → 0). [src/pilot/RUN_FREQ_MAX.md](src/pilot/RUN_FREQ_MAX.md) updated with the optimized
  run loop and the three-gate QA stack.

## 2026-06-26

### Stale-doc cleanup — align planning/runbook docs with the current pipeline
- Triaged the pwg_ru `.md` set against current ground truth (judge = Sonnet-bulk + Opus-on-reject;
  four prompt nits done-in-harness; harvest ported; `pwg_preverb1.txt` sandhi-join dropped;
  `--root-split` hook done). Fixed present-tense contradictions, kept correct history intact:
  - **STRATEGY.md** (judge-every-card now attributes Sonnet-bulk/Opus-on-reject),
    **FREQ_TEST_RUNBOOK.md** (step-2 judge model; +dropped-`pwg_preverb1` note; +four-nits/`nws_split`
    done-status note), **HANDOFF** (judge-model line scoped to the validation pass; dropped the
    `pwg_preverb1` follow-up).
  - Superseded-pointers added to the pre-Max-harness plans **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** /
    **PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md**; **PILOT_COST.md** §7 "now-implemented" note; **research/ROOT_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE.md**
    `--root-split`-done note. `JUDGE_POLICY.md` is the single source of truth for the judge policy.
- `tmp.md` (chat-narration scratch) left untouched — it is gitignored (`.gitignore:6`), never in the repo.

### Judge escalation implemented — Sonnet bulk, Opus only on the hard cases
- Flipped [src/pilot/run_pilot_wf.js](src/pilot/run_pilot_wf.js) from "Opus judges every card" to
  the decided [research/JUDGE_POLICY.md](research/JUDGE_POLICY.md) policy: **Sonnet judges every
  card; Opus re-judges ONLY a reject** (`isHard` = `ok=false || severity>=3`). The Opus verdict is
  final (becomes `judge`; Sonnet's original kept as `judge_sonnet`, `escalated:true`). Publishable
  cards (sev 1–2) spend **zero Opus tokens** → weekly-quota headroom (PILOT_COST §6/§7), the binding
  constraint on a single Max seat.
- Pipeline now 3-stage (Translate · Judge · Adjudicate); judge prompt factored model-neutral
  (`judgePrompt`/`CHECKS`). Justified by the A/B in JUDGE_AB.md (κ=1.0 over 474 cards, ~0.5 %
  disagreement). `node --check` clean; `_pilot_collect.py` reads `judge` (now the final verdict)
  unchanged. JUDGE_POLICY.md + RUN_FREQ_MAX.md marked implemented. **TODO:** wire the periodic ~5 %
  Opus audit of clean-passed cards (rollout step 3) into the window loop.

### Pre-launch audit + harvest ported into the production Max harness
- **Launch-readiness audit (Track A).** Verdict: **Sonnet translator is GREEN to start the
  first instrumented window.** All 4 "pre-run prompt nits" are confirmed already encoded in
  [src/pilot/run_pilot_wf.js](src/pilot/run_pilot_wf.js) (HARD RULES 3/4/5 + the NWS owner-map);
  all 8 harness/gate scripts exist and are wired (`nws_split.py` quarantine + `audit_translation.py`
  fidelity gate). The only true finding: the harness **inlines its own prompt** and does not read
  `pwg_ru_prompts/*.txt`, so the literature-harvest refinements had not reached the run.
- **Harvest ported into the live harness.** Added Sanskrit-microstructure rendering guidance to
  `run_pilot_wf.js` (samāsa right-headedness + `-ādi`=hypernym, the *yad…tad* correlative map,
  śāstric formulas, synonym-string cardinality, comma/semicolon sense-grouping, manner/position
  forcing) + judge check 7. Apresjan discrimination, the kośa two-source principle, and
  equivalence-type were already live. `node --check` clean.
- **Runbook refreshed.** [src/pilot/RUN_FREQ_MAX.md](src/pilot/RUN_FREQ_MAX.md): the stale "one-time
  nits" section is now a verification checklist (all done-in-harness); the window loop gained the
  `SECTION='a'→'freq'` warning and the `audit_translation.py` fidelity-gate step.
- **Findings status map.** [MANUALS_FIVE_DEEP_DIVE.md](MANUALS_FIVE_DEEP_DIVE.md) closing section
  rewritten from a "queued" list to a per-finding **pipeline-status table** (live / ported /
  deferred). Riemer's sense-distinctness battery and Klosa's display layer are marked deliberately
  out of scope for the bulk translation step (PWG sense division is authoritative; display is a
  post-translation frontend concern). pwg_ru.md gains a "теоретическая основа" pointer block.

### Literature shelf mined for pwg_ru → folded into prompts, glossary, and docs
- New [LITERATURE_FOR_PWG_RU.md](LITERATURE_FOR_PWG_RU.md): three-pass full-text harvest of
  the whole `literature/md/` reference shelf, distilled into drop-ins **by insertion point** —
  §1 glossary tables (canonical RU grammar terms, the *yad…tad*→correlative map, a 19th-c.
  German→RU spelling/term decoder, the Apresjan register tagset), §2 translator-prompt rules,
  §3 QA-judge defect classes, §4 corpus-gate/strata rules, §5 web display.
- New per-manual audit [MANUALS_FOR_PWG_RU.md](MANUALS_FOR_PWG_RU.md): walks all **37**
  `Lexicography-Manuals/` one at a time with a verdict each — **19 drive theory · 2 marginal ·
  15 serve other repos · 1 OCR-blocked** (Rātānjanakar; not a run blocker).
- New deep-dive [MANUALS_FIVE_DEEP_DIVE.md](MANUALS_FIVE_DEEP_DIVE.md): detailed,
  text-grounded theoretical input of the 5 load-bearing manuals (Apresjan · Riemer ·
  Hartmann & James · Gonda–Vogel · Klosa) for the Sanskrit–Russian dictionary, with
  quotations + page/chapter anchors, a "→ Sa–Ru application" per point, and a
  "how the five compose" synthesis (Riemer→Hartmann→Apresjan decision chain;
  Apresjan⇄Klosa glossary/reverse-index loop).
- **Folded into the live prompts:** [pwg_ru_prompts/1_perevod.txt](pwg_ru_prompts/1_perevod.txt)
  gains compound-type (samāsa) rendering, case-absolute constructions, śāstric formulas, and a
  pointer to the new manual glossary; [pwg_ru_prompts/2_qa_sudya_opus.txt](pwg_ru_prompts/2_qa_sudya_opus.txt)
  gains the matching judge defect classes.
- New hand-curated glossary [glossaries/de_ru_translation_aids.md](glossaries/de_ru_translation_aids.md)
  (compound-type RU names, case-absolute constructions, śāstric formulas, the correlative map,
  the 19th-c. German orthography decoder), each row sourced to a `LITERATURE_FOR_PWG_RU.md`
  section. This is the **one manually-maintained** file in `glossaries/` (the rest are
  `renou_glossary.py`-generated).

### Renou register glossaries — first tangible artifacts from the register axis
- New [src/renou_glossary.py](src/renou_glossary.py): filter the Renou-tagged dictionaries
  by register / state / provenance → a deduplicated headword glossary (aggregated by IAST
  across the 8 dicts; each row = states · register provenance ls/dcs · dicts · senses).
  Supports `--state`, `--exclude-state` (cross-axis slices), `--prov`, `--min-dicts`,
  `--state-only`, md/tsv.
- Shipped **8 glossaries** in [glossaries/](glossaries/README.md): register lexica —
  **épigraphique** (709 inscriptional words: `akṣayanīvī`, `abhayagirivihāra`, dynastic
  names), **bhāṣya** (14,498; 10,320 in ≥2 dicts), **kāvya** (26,973), **bauddha** (25,740),
  **jaina** (286); cross-axis slices — Vedic-in-commentary (`bhasya∩I`, 6,895), born-in-kāvya
  (`kavya∖I`, 20,758), Vedic-only archaisms (`state I` only, 25,220). Headline finding:
  **484 of 709 épig words (68 %) are corpus-absent** — attested only in inscriptions, so a
  corpus-only method never sees them. The clearest proof the register axis adds signal the
  state axis can't.

### Comparison tables — rows sorted chronologically by edition year
- [`../article-comparison/*.table.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/tree/master/article-comparison)
  rows now run **oldest → newest** by edition year (WIL 1832 → YAT 1846 → BOP 1847 →
  PWG Bd. I 1855 → … → AP 1957 → PE 1975 → PD 1976), so the side-by-side reads as the
  tradition developing. `#` renumbered; sort lives in `src/_build_tables.py` (stable on
  prior order for same-year ties). (semver `[0.0.12]`)

## 2026-06-25

### Comparison tables — full untruncated entries + the builder, committed
- The side-by-side [`../article-comparison/*.table.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/tree/master/article-comparison)
  capped each cell at ~800 chars with a trailing ` …`; long entries (STC, PWG, AP90,
  VCP, PE…) showed only a fragment. **Every cell now carries the complete entry**
  (citations `[ ]` stripped, SLP1→IAST, paragraphs joined with ▸); **40** truncated
  cells expanded. PD stays its full sense skeleton (verbatim PD is 20–234 KB).
- Committed the previously-uncommitted table builder as
  [src/_build_tables.py](src/_build_tables.py): regenerates all four tables from the
  full `*.iast.md` sections + the `*.pd-min.md` skeleton, no length cap, with
  **nested-citation-safe** bracket stripping (fixes a stray `]` the old run left on
  nested refs like `[m., [RāmatUp.]]` in akṣara/MW). (semver `[0.0.11]`)

### agni gloss review — agent draft pass over the 130 hand-authored RU glosses
- Produced [`../article-comparison/agni.gloss-review.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/blob/master/article-comparison/agni.gloss-review.md):
  an Opus-4.8 editorial review of agni's 130 hand-authored Russian sense-glosses against
  the English PD sense, the Sanskrit term, and Russian Indological convention
  (Kochergina / Elizarenkova). **The glosses are untouched** — the output is a
  sign-off worklist for the human editor. Findings: **1 H** (the *agnicayana*
  altar↔rite category error at 4i/4vi), **3 M** (ахаванья→ахавания, hotṛ
  "возливатель"→"призыватель", udātta precision), **3 L** polish, **4** optional
  add-glosses, **6 FYI** English-source OCR typos the RU already corrects.
- This is the **agent-doable half** of the remaining Track B item; the final scholarly
  sign-off on the proposals is the human step. (semver `[0.0.10]`)

### Comparison tables — dictionary edition year on every quote
- Each row of [`../article-comparison/*.table.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/tree/master/article-comparison)
  now carries the source dictionary's **edition year**, not just the four EN dicts
  that already had one. Years are pulled from the authoritative
  [CDSL front page](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/) catalog (mirrored in
  `csl-guides/src/data/dictionaries.json`): PWG 1855, pw/PWK 1879, AP90 1890,
  AP 1957, GRA 1873, SHS 1900, VCP 1873, SKD 1886, BUR 1866, CAE 1891, WIL 1832,
  BEN 1866, MW 1899 / MW72 1872, YAT 1846, BOP 1847, STC 1932, PE 1975, PD 1976.
  Header provenance note added. (semver `[0.0.8]`)

### Track B tail — Max-LLM residual per-sense assignment (article-comparison closed)
- **What.** Closed the per-sense corpus tail for the comparison study. Every attested
  Russian rendering that the deterministic matcher dropped into the
  `### Не привязано к значению` bucket of each
  [`../article-comparison/*.persense-ru.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/SanskritLexicography/tree/main/article-comparison)
  was adjudicated by an **Opus-4.8** pass against the full bilingual PD sense
  skeleton and routed to its specific sense — or kept as honest *other*.
- **Coverage** (per-sense, of aligned occurrences): **agni 100 %** (det 2199 + LLM 16),
  **akṣara 99 %** (237 + 28), **anya 97 %** (1104 + 46), **ananta 97 %** (141 + 13).
  The deterministic pass alone was 97–99 %; the LLM pass closes the synonym /
  paraphrase / pre-1918-orthography tail (e.g. `Агни-Джатаведас`→*as jātavedas*,
  `жертвах`→*sacrifice*, `не гибнет`→*imperishable*, `иныхъ`→*another/other*).
- **How — reproducible, not a one-off LLM call.** Decisions are frozen as an
  `LLM_ASSIGN` override map in [src/_build_persense_ru.py](src/_build_persense_ru.py)
  (surface form → 0-based sense ordinal), mirroring the existing `SYN`/`ROUTE`
  mechanism. Re-running the builder reproduces the assignment deterministically.
  LLM-assigned renderings carry a **°** marker in the table; the coverage line now
  reports the deterministic-vs-LLM split; the residual heading documents that the
  pass ran and what genuinely remains (function words, context fragments,
  off-headword names with no PD sense to bind).
- **Flagship pair (agni + akṣara) priority** per the 2026-06-25 handoff; anya/ananta
  done as supporting examples (confident routes only — the rest left honestly in
  *other*, since anya is a pronoun with a long function-word tail).
- **Still open (heavier editorial pass, not this commit):** publication-quality review
  of the hand-authored RU sense-glosses for the flagship pair (`agni`'s 130 senses).

### Judge-model A/B settled — Sonnet for the bulk judge, Opus for repass + audit
- **Question:** can a cheaper **Sonnet** QA judge replace the **Opus** judge for the scale-up?
  Tested across 5 runs / ~650 judged cards ([research/JUDGE_AB.md](research/JUDGE_AB.md),
  [research/JUDGE_POLICY.md](research/JUDGE_POLICY.md)).
- **Result — indistinguishable.** Run 3 (201 real a-section cards): 191/191 verdict agreement,
  κ = 1.0, 0 Sonnet false-clears. Run 4 (250-item **ground-truth** defect battery — dropped
  anchor / falsified citation / dropped sense / translated Latin / changed number): both **99 %
  recall, 0 % false-positives**, head-to-head 208/208 with each model missing one *different*
  card. No Opus power advantage for the mechanical core of judging.
- **Decision:** Sonnet judges the bulk (≈ halves the judge token cost / Max-quota), Opus
  re-judges every **reject** + a periodic **~5 % audited sample** (halt if false-clear > 1 % or
  κ < 0.7). New [src/judge_disagreements.py](src/judge_disagreements.py) emits a full-context
  queue of the rare Opus-vs-Sonnet conflicts for editor adjudication;
  [src/judge_ab_score.py](src/judge_ab_score.py) scores any A/B.
- **Dropped the synthetic semantic-defect test** on the editor's objection: a wrong-but-related
  gloss (`Theil` → часть vs доля) is **undecidable from a word pair** without the full entry +
  the Sanskrit sense; the decidable cases are rude ones Sonnet already catches. The only honest
  semantic ground truth = real Opus-vs-Sonnet disagreements adjudicated in context — and those
  run **~0.5 %** (0 in run 3, 2 in run 4), so the adjudication queue is near-empty.
- **Lesson kept:** don't build a synthetic test whose ground truth you can't defend; for
  translation correctness the only honest ground truth is the entry in full context.

### Renou *register* axis — subsections as an orthogonal tag (épigraphique, bhāṣya, …)
- **Reread the source.** Renou's five states = his five *chapters*; his *subsections* are
  distinct registers a flat I–V tag can't express. Verified the table des matières from
  the scan → [`../../VisualDCS/docs/Renou_1956_structure.md`](https://github.com/gasyoun/VisualDCS/blob/main/docs/Renou_1956_structure.md):
  **`épigraphique`** lives in Ch. II (p. 94) and **`bhāṣya`** (commentary, its own grammar)
  leads Ch. IV (p. 133) — neither fits the five states. Design in
  [RENOU_SUBSECTIONS_PLAN.md](RENOU_SUBSECTIONS_PLAN.md).
- **New orthogonal `renou_register` field** (multi-label, 20-code lattice), parallel to
  the state — a word can carry registers across eras (a *bhāṣya* on a Vedic base). Two
  provenance-tagged detector routes, same lossless min-support policy as states:
  - **DCS corpus** ([src/build_dcs_renou.py](src/build_dcs_renou.py)): per-lemma `register`
    + `register_support {n,conf}` in the same scan; genre→register + name-stem detectors
    (esp. `bhāṣya` by `*bhāṣya/ṭīkā/vṛtti/…` — DCS has no commentary genre).
  - **`<ls>` citation** ([src/renou_register.py](src/renou_register.py), new): siglum's
    map record → register(s) (PWG genre / MW name); the only route for **`jaina`** (288 MW)
    + `bhāṣya` corroboration (Sāy/Kāś/Pat). Inline dicts (ap/ben/bhs) via
    `renou_sigla.SIGLUM_REGISTER` + `bhs`→`bauddha` wholesale.
  - **dedicated `épig` detector**: an inscription marker in `<ls>` text (`Insch?r`) →
    `epig` (MW 687, AP 17, PWG 9; sparse, as inscriptions are).
- **Wired end-to-end**: `renou.filter_dcs_registers`, the taggers emit `renou_register` +
  `renou_register_provenance` (`ls`/`dcs`/both), `renou_audit.py` register mode
  (coverage + per-register provenance + low-info), `renou_portrait.py` register sub-label
  + a `bhāṣya` editorial note. Coverage ~19–100 % of entries/dict; every lattice register
  populated except `hors_inde` (no source). **The state axis is unchanged.** Use cases in
  [RENOU.md](RENOU.md#use-cases).

### TRIAGE: pre-sorted the legacy `needs_review` queue for the human reviewer
- New tool [src/triage_review_queue.py](src/triage_review_queue.py) reads the
  gitignored `_review_queue.jsonl` (217 legacy `needs_review` cards already scored
  by the Opus QA judge) and **buckets the existing verdicts by defect type** —
  it does **not** re-judge or auto-edit anything. Classifies on the judge's
  *defect clauses* (not whole-reason keywords, which false-match the pass-narration)
  into: **C** source-data defect, **A** mechanical/format (untranslated German
  function-word, anchor/structure damage), **B** translation-quality doubt, plus a
  **FAST** likely-clean tier; orders by the judge's own severity.
- Result: **0 C · 13 A · 19 B · 185 FAST** (217 total). Only **23 cards score
  sev ≥ 2** — the real work; every "source quirk" was faithfully mirrored, so
  nothing escalates to Cologne. **197/217** carry an attested-dictionary
  corroboration. Ranked worklist → gitignored `src/_review_queue.triage.csv`;
  one-page reviewer guide → [REVIEW_QUEUE_TRIAGE.md](REVIEW_QUEUE_TRIAGE.md).
  Final adjudication stays human.

## 2026-06-24

### AUDIT: pruned 6 non-synonym kośas from the synonym channel (9.4 %→7.8 %)
- A data-quality audit of the just-shipped kośa fold (095bee1) found the first-pass
  inclusion of 10 kośas too loose: **6 inject non-synonymy** and were removed from
  [src/build_kosha.py](src/build_kosha.py) `KOSHAS`:
  `anekArthadhvanimanjarI` (homonym/polysemy lexicon — `svarga`↦गो/अक्षि/जल =
  cow/eye/water), `bhUtasankhyA` (number-code words, grouped only as "0"),
  `upasargArthachandrikA` (root↔prefixed-root derivation pairs), `jhaLkI-bhIma-nyAya`
  (word↔its-own-visarga-variant), `vaiShNava`/`shaiva-kosha` (HTML-table category
  labels — विष्णु "≈" ब्रह्मन्).
- Kept = the 4 true synonym (nāmamālā-genre) kośas: `amara-onto`, `nAmamAlikA`,
  `abhidhAnachintAmaNiparishiShTa`, `abhidhAnachintAmaNishilonCha`. Rebuilt:
  **103,518→88,839 rows, 9.4 %→7.8 % of PWG headwords.** Synonyms now clean
  (`svarga`→नाक/त्रिदिव/सुरलोक). Docs (eval §4b, README, prompt Rule 5) corrected.
- Cross-fact-check of all other indic-dict numeric claims (apte_hi 111,235, Hindi
  coverage 32.7 %, Meulenbeld 453/235, `heuristic()` isolation, vei/acc/ieg/pgn/snp =
  Cologne) — all re-derived and CONFIRMED accurate.

### indic-dict 2nd sweep — Sanskrit synonym-kośas + Meulenbeld binomials folded
- Full-repo survey of indic-dict cross-checked against csl-orig codes (the check caught
  4 false-new dupes: Vedic-Index=`vei`, Aufrecht-CC=`acc`, epigraphical-glossary=`ieg`,
  Gupta-names=`pgn`; Meulenbeld=`SNP`). Two genuinely non-Cologne assets folded:
- **Sanskrit synonym-kośas** → gate's `skd_vcp_synonyms` (Rule 5, Sanskrit-side
  corroboration; the first real source there — SKD/VCP were never wired).
  [src/build_kosha.py](src/build_kosha.py) parses 10 synonym/homonym kośas (Amarakośa
  `amara-onto` with its explicit `समानार्थक:` field, anekārtha-, nāmamālikā, Abhidhāna
  supplements, …) → **103,518 rows, 9.4 % of PWG headwords**. Verified: `arka`→अरुण/
  अर्यमन् (sun), `deva`→अमर/अमर्त्य, `aMSa`→भाग. Excluded after sampling: `amara-sudhA`
  (Pāṇinian prakriyā/derivation — not synonyms), `laxaNa-sangraha` (nyāya definitions),
  `ekAkSharanAmamAlA` (verse-only), `e-bhAratI-sampat`.
- **Meulenbeld plant→Latin binomial** (= SNP). [src/build_meulenbeld.py](src/build_meulenbeld.py)
  → **453 plants, 235 with a binomial** (`ajamodA`→*Apium graveolens*); surfaces as
  card `latin_binomials` — deterministic fix for the binomial-left-untranslated failure.
- `corpus_gate.py`: `load_kosha_index`/`lookup_synonyms` + `load_plant_index`/
  `lookup_binomials`; `build_card` now populates `skd_vcp_synonyms` + `latin_binomials`;
  coverage cmd + lookup print extended. Prompt Rule 5 + input schema updated.
  Full survey (incl. the 5 header-checked en-entries: MT-Slang/pract/pund_v1/Vaidya/
  laukika — all low-value) in [INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md](INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md) §4b.

### Freq test — Opus judge pass: 37/38 publishable (sev ≤ 2)
- Judged all 38 outputs (38 Opus agents, 2.4 min, 2.06 M tok): severity **{1: 24, 2: 13, 3: 1}**,
  discrimination "good" on every polysemous unit. The judge caught issues the fidelity gate +
  3-agent spot-check missed: **`idam` (sev 3)** = translator swapped NWS owner rows Geldner↔Graßmann
  (the F12 the owner-map prevents) — but the authoritative map is CORRECT, so it's a translator slip
  on a hard double-Geldner case that the production `nws_split.py check` gate catches (my test was
  translate-only). `k_arya` (sev 2) dropped 2 Nachträge patches; `jana`/`pw00` (sev 2) minor sigla
  (token merge; `Bed.`→«значением»). Prompt-tuning findings recorded in the runbook; the pipeline
  is scale-ready pending those nits + wiring `nws_split` into the loop.
- **Item dropped — sandhi-join prefix portrait is FUTILE**: validated only **3/15** of `man`'s
  prefixed surface forms are corpus-attested (anuman/abhiman/avaman) regardless of sandhi spelling —
  `pwg_preverb1.txt`'s join gives the SAME strings; the limit is **corpus coverage**, so the
  `root-fallback`+defer-to-German interim is already optimal. Large-non-giant overflow: 4/64 top
  freq nouns >400 lines (kāla 530, ka 522, śrī 412, para 401, ~6%) — head-splitter extension is a
  conditional follow-up (overflow at ~520 lines untested).

### Freq 38-unit test TRANSLATED + glued + audited (split→translate→glue end-to-end)
- Ran the prepped freq test (8 nouns + giant `man`, 38 units) via the Workflow tool
  (38 Sonnet agents, ~14-way concurrency) → **38/38 translated**; `root_glue_translated.py man`
  → **30/30 sub-cards glued, 0 pending** → `man.NESTED.md` (797 lines, correct structure:
  Омоним 1 simple-verb → caus/desid → 18 prefixes; Омоним 2 + PW/SCH/PWKVN last). **10.5 min,
  1.61 M tokens** (avg inflated by the 8 big nouns; `man` sub-cards median 9 output lines).
- **Apresjan evidence-weighting validated live**: the `ava` agent used the corpus hint
  «смотреть свысока» but rejected it as colloquial for the scholarly «презирать» (avamāna =
  contempt); `pari` saw `evidence_scope='root-fallback'` and deferred to the German gloss.
- **Audited.** New deterministic gate [src/audit_translation.py](src/audit_translation.py)
  (judge-independent; complements the Opus judge + `nws_split` owner-map check): **38/38 clean**
  — `<ls>` citations ≥90 % preserved, `{#…#}` Sanskrit ≥85 %, Russian present everywhere.
  Semantic spot-check (3 `fact-check-against-source` agents): `anu`/`nara` PASS (NWS owner-map
  12/12 verbatim, EN glosses from EN), `ava` substantively PASS. 2 trivial nits: `ava`
  "ein Schol."→«один» (borderline-correct gloss prose), `nara` a Hoernle multi-cite NWS row
  compressed (NWS guard-4 follow-up). The Opus severity judge was **not** run (translate-only,
  to bound cost) — run separately before print-ready. Outputs gitignored.

### Frequency-first queue RUN at volume + root-split hardened + audited
- **Freq queue runs** (`_pilot_gen_merged.py --manifest freq --root-split`): top-50 =
  40 giant roots → 2,316 single-pass sub-cards, none overflow. Two fixes unblocked the
  volume run: **resumability composition** (`is_done`/`is_giant` — a giant root with only a
  stale whole-card input is still re-split; the superseded whole-card is then removed), and
  the **multi-homonym fix** (hit 19/50 top roots): `gen_root_split` segmented only `bufs[0]`,
  so a giant verb root at a non-zero homonym index (√i at hom 2 = 114 prefixes; mā/As/vā/iṣ)
  was missed and extra giant homonyms (gam/as/dā) dropped. Now segments **every** homonym,
  splits each giant one, keeps small ones whole, attaches supplements once; rootmap gains a
  `hom` field; `root_glue_translated` orders (hom→seg→part), supplements last; secondary
  (caus/desid, `<div n="p">— <ab>caus.</ab>` via `SEC_DIVP_RE`) preserved + nested with the
  simple verb.
- **Apresjan evidence on sub-cards (interim)**: the split path wrote `[]` portraits →
  evidence-blind giants. `subcard_portrait` now writes real `corpus_synonyms` keyed by the
  right form — head/secondary → the root (`man` → считать/думать); prefix → the prefixed
  SURFACE form (`anu+man` → одобрять, `ava+man` → смотреть свысока, unlike bare `man`),
  `evidence_scope='prefixed-form'` when the corpus has it, else `root-fallback` (weak hint;
  the translate prompt is told to defer to the German gloss). Residual: sandhi/stacked
  prefixes need `pwg_preverb1.txt`'s `join_prefix_verb` surface form (proper later fix).
- **Sub-card plumbing through Max**: `run_pilot_wf.js` (`fileOf`) and `_pilot_collect.py`
  keep a `~~` sub-card stem verbatim instead of re-`safe_name`-ing it, so
  `<subkey>.raw.txt` → `<subkey>.merged.md` flows into the glue. 38-unit freq test
  ([pilot/FREQ_TEST_RUNBOOK.md](src/pilot/FREQ_TEST_RUNBOOK.md): 8 nouns + giant `man`).
- **Audited** ([src/audit_root_split.py](src/audit_root_split.py) + the maintainer's
  [src/verify_root_glue.py](src/verify_root_glue.py)): corpus-wide losslessness PASS (1226
  records, 0 failures); 60/60 top giant roots LOSSLESS · all homonyms split · glue-complete
  · portraits present (3,035 sub-cards); whole-card regression OK; csl-orig untouched.

### indic-dict Hindi sense signal folded into the stage-4 gate
- **License cleared** (free use with attribution, all four Indic-gloss dicts, by email)
  → folded the two Hindi ones as a soft **third-language sense signal** (which sense is
  primary), never a correctness vote. New [src/build_indic.py](src/build_indic.py)
  parses the `.babylon` exports (Devanagari headword → Hindi gloss) into SLP1-keyed
  JSONL: **111,235 `apte_hi` + 6,166 `vedic_rituals_hi`**. apte-hi cites nominatives
  (अग्निः→`agniH`), so each row also carries a `stem` key and is indexed under both.
- **Gate:** [src/corpus_gate.py](src/corpus_gate.py) gains a `SENSE` index +
  `lookup_sense()`; `build_card` emits `hindi_sense`; kept **out** of the Russian-token
  `heuristic()`. [pwg_ru_prompts/4_korpus_proverka.txt](pwg_ru_prompts/4_korpus_proverka.txt)
  gains Rule 8 + the `hindi_sense` input field + `"Hindi"` in `corroborated_by`.
- **Coverage:** Hindi sense gloss for **32.7 %** of PWG headwords (apte_hi 31.7 %,
  vedic 2.3 %) — ~2× the Russian correctness coverage (16.4 %). Verified joins: `agni`
  (4 senses incl. the three ritual fires), `arTa`, `aMSa` (कंधा = «плечо»).
- Kannada (`shabdArtha_kaustubha`) / Tamil (`samskritam-tamizham`) held pending a
  reader. Full assessment in [INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md](INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md).

### indic-dict / stardict-sanskrit evaluated as a source — declined, deferred
- New [INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md](INDIC_DICT_EVALUATION.md). Most of the repo
  (en-head reverse indexes, EN/FR/DE/SA gloss sets) is **Cologne-generated** —
  csl-orig already holds fresher copies, so it adds nothing. The only net-new content
  is four **Indic-language gloss** dictionaries: `apte-hi` (Hindi, 19.6 MB, Apte→Hindi),
  `vedic-rituals-hi` (Hindi, Vedic-ritual, 3.3 MB), `shabdArtha_kaustubha` (Kannada,
  34.9 MB — `bookname` mistags it `sa-sa`), `samskritam-tamizham` (Tamil, blog scrape).
- **Role:** none is Sa→Ru, so none is a translation layer. At most a **soft cross-lingual
  sense vote** in the stage-4 gate — corroborates *which sense is primary*, never the
  Russian wording; `apte-hi` is the standout (Apte-aligned → structured sense map).
- **Blocker:** the repo has **no license** (SPDX `none`; `.babylon` headers carry only
  `#bookname`). Decision: note the gap, record the technical fit, **defer ingestion**.
  Pointers added to [DICTIONARY_CHAIN.md](DICTIONARY_CHAIN.md) and
  [SAMUDRA_INTEGRATION.md](SAMUDRA_INTEGRATION.md) §2.

### Renou tag validation + DCS over-tag min-support fix
- **Validation by inter-signal agreement** (no human labels): new
  [src/renou_audit.py](src/renou_audit.py) cross-tabulates the four provenance
  signals per dictionary, treats `<ls>` (the lexicographer's citation) as the trusted
  anchor, and quantifies the dominant accuracy risk — `dcs` over-tagging. The DCS index
  is keyed by bare lemma, so homographs collapse to one entry carrying the *union* of
  all eras (`akāra`, the letter, inherited I–V), and the tagger kept only the state list
  — a one-text state was indistinguishable from a hundred-text one. Findings:
  `dcs`-widening is the dominant disagreement (MW 52 %, BEN 76 %, AP90 79 % of both-
  signal entries) and 42–90 % of `dcs` assertions are uncorroborated by `ls`/`bhs`.
  Report → gitignored `src/renou_audit_report.md`.
- **The fix (applied):** [src/build_dcs_renou.py](src/build_dcs_renou.py) now records
  lossless per-state `state_support` `{n_texts, best_confidence}`, and
  `renou.filter_dcs_states()` ([src/renou.py](src/renou.py)) applies the policy at
  *tagger* time (tunable, no rescan): **keep a `dcs` state iff ≥`DCS_MIN_SUPPORT` (=2)
  texts OR ≥1 confidently-typed text** (authoritative DCS genre / curated Buddhist–
  grammar name hint). Wired into `tag_dict_from_source.py` / `tag_mw_from_source.py`
  (`--dcs-min-support N`). Effect: **9.9 % of `dcs` state-assignments pruned** (14.8 %
  of lemmas) — almost all spurious **IV** (9,736; the `date≥400` fallback bucket) and
  **I** (2,923); **0 state-II / 0 state-V** dropped (those come only from typed
  Vyākaraṇa / Buddhist texts, so the curated signal is untouched). The residual
  `ca`/`idam`/`akāra` = I–V breadth is *not* pruned — it is corpus-accurate (high-conf
  support in every era), merely uninformative → a display concern, not an error.
- Index + all 8 `{code}.renou.jsonl` regenerated; [RENOU.md](RENOU.md) gained a
  Validation section + refreshed post-policy coverage table. The `wl` (wisdomlib) layer
  was reconstructed losslessly from surviving intermediates (V-by-source `wl` counts
  match the originals exactly). Shipped in `ecc7bb9` (core) + `9666591` (docs/audit).

### Root-entry segmenter suite (the giant-root fix) + external resources
- **The structural fix for "translation pass dies on bhū/vid":** a root mega-record is now
  split into per-prefix sub-cards and gluable back. Built one at a time in
  [research/](research/) (full write-up: [research/ROOT_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE.md](research/ROOT_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE.md) §BUILDS A–C):
  - `root_segment_proto.py` — lossless `<div n="p">` slicer; `root_glue.py` — SPLIT→NESTED
    glue (PWG + MW), cap-aware via the link table; `root_units.py` — segments a root record
    into per-prefix **translation units** in the `compile_translatable` manifest shape
    (`BU`→380 units).
  - `lex_noun_link.py` — PWG nominal→root chain table (34.8 % linked, dict-field-first);
    `mw_deriv.py` — MW derivation oracle + link table (133.7 k rows) from Funderburk's
    `MWderivations`; `root_merge.py` — PWG↔MW merged comparative article (bhū 33/41 aligned);
    `apte_parse.py` — Apte Sanskrit–Hindi → independent root oracle (1,654 dhātus, 793 not in
    verbs01) + `productivity` (affix-productivity from 38,757 `+`-etymologies: upasarga×root —
    `vi`>`sam`>`pra` — and kṛt/taddhita pratyaya×root — `kta`>`ṭāp`>`lyuṭ`>`ac` — cross-listed
    with MWderivations' `wsfx` surface-suffix counts `-tva`>`-tā`>`-vat`; → `apte_productivity.tsv`).
    `apte_parse.py crossmap` + curated `affix_map.tsv` **bridge the two lenses**
    (Pāṇinian pratyaya ↔ surface suffix ↔ MW wsfx, via anubandha-stripping): they OVERLAP on
    transparent taddhita but MW≫Apte there (`tva` 11 vs 1996 — Apte rarely cites the obvious
    suffix), while Apte alone covers the kṛt formation affixes (`kta`/`ghañ`/`lyuṭ`/`ṭāp`, MW
    wsfx=0 — lexicalised headwords). Complementary coverage, now quantified.
- **Teaching layer (for Sanskrit affixation):** one dataset `affix_pedagogy.json` (27 affixes in
  13 function groups, with surface form, Pāṇinian pratyaya, anubandha-stripping steps, Apte
  productivity, MW count, real example derivatives) feeds four artifacts: `affix_explorer.html`
  (interactive, function-grouped, productivity bars, click-to-decode — also wired into the
  **WhitneyRoots** reader, [PR #21](https://github.com/gasyoun/WhitneyRoots/pull/21)),
  `affix_poster.html` (printable one-page wall chart), `affix_quiz.html` (data-driven MCQ drill),
  and `affix_flashcards.tsv` (Anki/Quizlet-importable). Built by `affix_pedagogy.py` +
  `build_affix_explorer.py` + `build_affix_teaching.py`.
- **Wired into the pipeline (the unblocker):** `_pilot_gen_merged.py --root-split` (also
  `--manifest freq --root-split`) auto-detects a giant root (≥8 prefix divisions) and explodes
  it into one single-pass-sized sub-card per prefix — HEAD card keeps the simple verb + all
  supplements + NWS owner map; each prefix sub-card is its own `<div n="p">` block — plus a
  `<safe>.rootmap.json` for `root_glue` reassembly. `BU`→41 sub-cards (head 820 lines + 93-entry
  owner map; `anu` prefix card 87 lines vs the 1315-line whole record), `gam`→63. This lets the
  frequency-first queue (top = sthā/bhū/gam) run without the single-pass death.
- **Glue-after-translate (round-trip closed):** `root_glue_translated.py <root>` reads the
  `rootmap.json` + each sub-card's translated `<subkey>.merged.md` and stitches them back into
  one `<safe>.NESTED.md` Russian article (head → prefixes by seg order; missing → pending).
  Demoed on `BU`: 3 prefix sub-cards (anu/abhi/ud) translated → glued into the 41-sub-card
  nested article, each in its slot, Sanskrit/sigla preserved. SPLIT→translate→GLUE confirmed.
- **Head-card sense-splitter (the gate confirmed it was needed):** a single-pass translation of
  the 820-line `bhū` HEAD overflowed the 32k-token output limit and wrote nothing. So
  `_pilot_gen_merged.py` now splits the head into single-pass parts — simple-verb senses chunked at
  `<div`/blank boundaries (budget 100, cap 1.5×), each supplement layer (PW/SCH/PWKVN) chunked, the
  NWS owner map batched (25/unit); prefix sub-cards are chunked the same way. `BU` → 56 sub-cards
  (14 head-parts + 40 prefix), **every one ≤143 lines**; `gam` → 81. PWG side stays lossless.
  `root_glue_translated.py` orders by (seg_index, part) and labels the parts.
- **Scale-proven:** `scale_test.py` segments **all 1,163 PWG verb roots, 100 % LOSSLESS**;
  the slicer's 8,588 prefix-divisions vs verbs01's 8,361 vetted upasargas (+227 FP gap, 159
  roots) confirm the false-positive guard is needed at scale.
- **Reuse, not reinvention** (per *check-prior-art*): the segmenter sits on Jim Funderburk's
  [`PWG/verbs01/`](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/PWG/tree/master/verbs01) (sandhi join +
  MW alignment already done) and [`MWderivations`](https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWderivations)
  (220 k MW headwords classified pfx/cpd/wsfx). Cross-check: `MWderivations/compounds.txt` is
  byte-identical to `WhitneyRoots/MW_compounds_12610.txt`. External data vendored gitignored
  under `research/external/`; `research/apte_roots.tsv` + `research/lex_noun_link_pwg.tsv` tracked.

## 2026-06-23

### Scaled + handed off (translation pipeline)
- **Owner-map feed — F12 eliminated by construction.** `_pilot_gen_merged.py` appends
  an AUTHORITATIVE "PRE-PARSED OWNER MAP" (deterministic `nws_split` triples) to each
  card's NWS layer; the translator emits one row per entry with the owner VERBATIM and
  never re-derives attribution. `run_pilot_wf.js` HARD RULE 5 + Guard 7 consume it.
- **Re-validated on fresh cards:** `ātman` CLEAN (13/13, incl. French TAK *le soi*→RU);
  `ās` went MISATTRIBUTION (3 owner-swaps, pre-fix) → **CLEAN** (0 mismatches) after the
  owner-map feed. First coverage-first batch of 6 (`as`/`A`/`anu`/`akṣa`/`arjuna` clean,
  `as` with 60 NWS owners CLEAN) = **5/6 first-pass clean**; `Ap` quarantined + re-queued.
- **Full a-section staged for the Max workflow:** regenerated **4,264 NWS a-cards** with
  owner maps (`--manifest a`); runbook [src/pilot/RUN_ASECTION_MAX.md](src/pilot/RUN_ASECTION_MAX.md)
  (per-window prep → run `run_pilot_wf.js` on Max → `run_real_test.py audit`; rejects
  auto-re-queue). Window 1 (`[0,50)`, 37 fresh) prepped.
- **Failure gallery:** F10 (Windows case-insensitive filename collision — would lose
  ~15 k headwords), F11 (editorial-intent fabrication), F12 (NWS cite-after-gloss
  off-by-one inherited by the judge). See [failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md](failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md).
- **Cost & feasibility re-grounded** — [PILOT_COST.md](PILOT_COST.md) §6: measured
  **0.78 tok/byte**; a-section ≈ **0.5–0.8 B** tokens, whole PWG dict ≈ **4–7 B**;
  throughput ~7 k cards/day at 24/7 (~15 days *continuous*) but **quota-bound to ~1–2
  months on one Max seat**. Documents the data gaps (Max weekly quota, typical-card
  cost, total size) and the one instrumented-window experiment that resolves them.

- **Frequency-first ordering (DCS) built + validated.** `freq_route.py` ranks PWG
  headwords by hybrid token×breadth×richness → `scale_manifest.freq.json` (41% DCS-attested;
  ~3.8k band-4+5 core). Top cards = verbal **roots** (sthā 379 senses, i 272, gam 213). Freq-
  first pipeline validated: `rūpa`/`rasa` CLEAN through the owner-map gate. **Finding:** roots
  (`vid` 74, `bhū` 131) fail single-pass translation ("connection closed mid-response") →
  root-entry sectioning is the open design question before scaling (pending manuals review).

- **Lexicography design studies — 3 handoff chats spawned.** The giant-root failure opened the
  microstructure question; decided the **two-mode root architecture** (SPLIT cards for translation +
  `root_key` linkage → glue to a NESTED root article on demand) and created 3 grounded research briefs
  in [research/](research/) — (A) root architecture, (B) sense ordering, (C) homonym/gloss/citation/
  run-on conventions — each spun off as its own cold handoff chat (`task_740ea467`/`task_2242dc13`/
  `task_9b9ce8db`) to read the OCRed prefaces + probe entries and fill a per-dict comparison table
  before scaling.

### Added
- **Renou language-state (I–V) tag on every cited sense.** Each dictionary
  *meaning* is now classified into one of Louis Renou's five states of Sanskrit
  (*Histoire de la langue sanskrite*, the five chapters): **I** Vedic, **II**
  Pāṇinian/grammarians', **III** Epic & prolongements, **IV** Classical, **V**
  Buddhist/Jaina. Derivation is **deterministic from the sense's `<ls>`
  citations** — no LLM — so it is fully auditable. A sense is **multi-label**
  (a meaning attested across eras carries all applicable states, e.g.
  `["I","III"]`), and its **oldest citation** is flagged separately
  (`renou_oldest`, plus `renou_oldest_sense` on the record) to answer "in which
  era was this meaning first attested".
  - [src/build_ls_map.py](src/build_ls_map.py): every curated PWG source in
    `CANON` carries a `renou` state; `ls_source_map.json` regenerated with it.
    PWG coverage — I 123 806 · II 25 291 · III 199 075 · IV 211 071 · V 0
    citations (PWG's curated canon has no Buddhist/Jaina source).
  - [src/build_ls_map_mw.py](src/build_ls_map_mw.py) (new): MW-side map
    (`ls_source_map_mw.json`), with an MW-specific siglum extractor (no `n=""`
    attribute; lowercase-roman volume refs stripped; `L.` kept as
    lexicographers). 77 sources, 84.1 % of MW `<ls>` citations; **state V
    populates here** (Buddh./Lalit./Divyāv./SaddhP./Jaina — 4 611 citations).
  - [src/renou.py](src/renou.py) (new): `states_for_text/keys` resolves
    citations → states, dict-aware (`pwg`/`mw`).
  - [src/annotate_renou.py](src/annotate_renou.py) (new): idempotent, BOM-free,
    temp-swap backfill of `renou` / `renou_oldest` onto final-card senses (and
    `renou_oldest_sense` per record); `--report` prints the I–V distribution,
    multi-label count and first-attestation breakdown.
  - [schemas/pwg_ru_final_card.schema.json](schemas/pwg_ru_final_card.schema.json):
    `renou` (array of I–V) and `renou_oldest` added to the sense as **optional**
    fields, and `renou_oldest_sense` to the record — existing MW/PWG cards stay
    valid.
  - Ran record-level on the legacy PWG store (`pwg_ru_translated.jsonl`, 217
    cards): **184 tagged (84.8 %)**, 45 multi-label · I 70 · II 21 · III 48 ·
    IV 106 · V 0.

- **DCS corpus enrichment of the Renou tag (second, provenance-tagged signal).**
  `<ls>` is authoritative but narrow (only cited sources); the Digital Corpus of
  Sanskrit (DCS, 2026 CoNLL-U, 270 texts / 5.46 M words) shows where a headword
  *lemma is actually attested*, recovering states the citations miss.
  - [src/build_dcs_renou.py](src/build_dcs_renou.py) (new): resolves each DCS text
    → Renou state (genre from VisualDCS `dcs_texts_clean.json`, name-hints for the
    Buddhist **V** / grammar **II** texts it misses, date fallback), then scans the
    corpus (lemma = CoNLL-U col 3) → `dcs_lemma_renou.json` (gitignored build
    artifact): **90 346 lemmas** → `{renou states, oldest text/date, n_texts}`.
  - [src/enrich_renou_dcs.py](src/enrich_renou_dcs.py) (new): joins the index to
    cards on `key1`→IAST, adding `renou_dcs`, `renou_dcs_oldest`, `renou_dcs_texts`,
    `renou_enriched` (ls ∪ dcs) and `renou_provenance` (`{state:["ls","dcs"]}`).
    DCS is per-lemma, so it merges at the card/record level and **never overwrites**
    the per-sense `<ls>` tag.
  - On the 217 PWG cards: 127 (58.5 %) DCS-hit, 83 gained ≥1 state; **state V
    went 0 → 37 cards** (Buddhist attestation `<ls>` never supplied). Enriched
    coverage I 93 · II 30 · III 90 · IV 136 · V 37.
  - **Scaled to the whole dictionary** — ran on `assembled_cards.jsonl`, all
    **120 173 PWG headwords** (key1→IAST join, no translations needed): **54 519
    (45.4 %) DCS-hit** → corpus-grounded Renou states. Coverage I 22 075 · II 4 926 ·
    III 31 187 · IV 35 544 · **V 10 171** (e.g. *akaniṣṭha, akṣayamati, akṣobhya* —
    Buddhist headwords `<ls>` never marks). DCS is itself built from GRETIL e-texts,
    so it already subsumes the raw-corpus layer; the 45.4 % ceiling is the
    exact-lemma-form join (rare/variant/compound headwords miss).
  - [src/add_corpus_renou.py](src/add_corpus_renou.py) (new): reusable augmenter
    that folds a raw IAST text (no lemmatiser) into the index at a given Renou
    state, word-FORM level — additive, idempotent (`__sources__` meta guards
    re-runs). Applied to GRETIL's **Skandapurāṇa Revākhaṇḍa** (state III): 25 075
    forms → 23 765 new form-keys + 184 existing lemmas gained III (index 90 346 →
    114 111). **Data-availability finding:** GRETIL serves only the Revākhaṇḍa for
    Skanda (the `sa_skandapurANa1-31` critical edition is listed but 404s in all
    formats); the Revākhaṇḍa is *already in DCS lemmatised*, so the fold is near-zero
    marginal on the 217-card sample (III unchanged). The full 81 k-verse vulgate is
    not available as clean Sanskrit e-text on GRETIL — the augmenter is ready for it
    when a source surfaces.
  - **Third tier — wisdomlib (built; reuses the existing Samudra crawler).** A word's
    wisdomlib **tradition** sections (Buddhism/Jainism/Ayurveda/Vyakarana/Vedic/…) give
    a tertiary, lower-confidence Renou hint (Buddhism/Jainism → **V**). New
    `SamudraManthanam/web/corpus_builder/wisdomlib/definitions.py` fetches `/definition/`
    pages **reusing `crawl.py`'s** polite fetch + `is_block_page`, parses tradition
    headings → `word_traditions.jsonl`. Consumer
    [src/enrich_renou_wisdomlib.py](src/enrich_renou_wisdomlib.py) (new) folds it into
    `renou_wl` + `renou_provenance` as source `"wl"` — never overriding `<ls>`/DCS; a
    state backed by `wl` alone is the weakest evidence. Join is on a diacritic-free key
    (wisdomlib ASCII slug `akshobhya` ↔ SLP1→IAST `akṣobhya`); consumer + parser
    self-test pass. **Blocked on live fetch:** wisdomlib is Cloudflare-gated per-IP (the
    crawler README's documented reality — `http=000` here), so `word_traditions.jsonl`
    must be produced gently from a residential connection, validating the parser with
    `definitions.py parse <page>` on the first real page.
  - **Parser validated on real pages (2026-06-24)** once the IP cooled: `akshobhya`/
    `bodhisattva` tradition extraction correct; fixed two bugs the run exposed — force
    HTTP/1.1 (wisdomlib drops HTTP/2 from this egress) and gloss count via
    `class="suffix source"` (Samudra PR #15). A real BHS batch (16,837 slugs) re-tripped
    the per-IP block, exposing + fixing two more: resumable (don't persist transient
    failures) and a timeout-aware circuit breaker.

- **BHS → PWG/MW/AP deterministic V transfer ([src/enrich_renou_bhs.py](src/enrich_renou_bhs.py), new).**
  Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary *is* the state-**V** register, so any
  headword present in BHS but lacking V in a mainstream dict is a missed attestation —
  filled deterministically, no fetching (what the Cloudflare-blocked wisdomlib batch was
  approximating). Adds V with provenance source `"bhs"` (an attestation claim, so common
  words used in Buddhist texts — e.g. *viṣṇu* — correctly gain a V-register attestation,
  marked `bhs`-only and distinguishable from `ls`/`dcs`/`wl`). **New V tags: MW 15 239 ·
  PWG 5 734 · AP 2 364 (23 337 total), plus 23 911 corroborated.** Join on the
  diacritic-free key; outputs `{store}.bhs.jsonl` (gitignored).

- **Consolidated into one pipeline + [RENOU.md](RENOU.md).**
  [src/renou_pipeline.py](src/renou_pipeline.py) (new) chains the four signals —
  `<ls>`+DCS (`tag_dict_from_source`) → BHS V (`enrich_renou_bhs`) → wisdomlib
  (`enrich_renou_wisdomlib`) — into one canonical `{code}.renou.jsonl` per dictionary,
  keyed by `key1`, with a states / V-by-source report. `--all` ran the **8 LS-rich
  dicts = 770 292 entries** (PWG 123 366 · MW 286 560 · PW 170 556 · AP 90 654 · AP90
  34 882 · SCH 29 125 · BEN 17 310 · BHS 17 839). [RENOU.md](RENOU.md) documents the
  five states, the four provenance sources + their trust, the per-dict coverage, and
  how to reproduce. Canonical indices are gitignored (regenerated by the pipeline).

- **Editorial layer — [src/renou_portrait.py](src/renou_portrait.py) (new).** Turns the
  signals into editor-facing output: `portrait(entry)` renders a headword's Renou era
  label (Russian), its first attestation, and a confidence note — a V supported only by
  `bhs` is flagged *register-only* (e.g. *viṣṇu* "V: только регистр (BHS)" vs *akṣobhya*
  V from `dcs+bhs+wl`). `order_senses_oldest_first(card)` reorders a structured card's
  senses earliest-attested-first (uses `renou_oldest_sense`; ready for the per-sense
  store, no-op without it). Demoed on MW.

- **Renou tagging extended to Monier-Williams (both layers).** The MW *Russian*
  cards live in a separate working repo, but the Renou tag is language-independent
  (headword + `<ls>`), so [src/tag_mw_from_source.py](src/tag_mw_from_source.py)
  (new) derives it straight from the MW source `csl-orig/v02/mw/mw.txt` and keys it
  by `key1` (joins to the Russian cards later) → `mw_renou.jsonl` (gitignored).
  All **286 560 MW entries**: **59.1 % `<ls>`-tagged**, **47.6 % DCS-hit**. The two
  signals now cross-check — `<ls>` state **V** = 4 503 (citation-based:
  Buddh./Lalit./Divyāv./SaddhP./Jaina), DCS state **V** = 38 200 (attestation-based),
  enriched union **41 195**, of which **1 508 are corroborated by BOTH `<ls>` and
  DCS** (e.g. *aṭaṭa* — a Buddhist hell — `ls=[V] dcs=[V]`). Per-entry
  `renou_provenance` records which signal(s) back each state.

- **Renou tagging extended to the 6 remaining LS-rich dictionaries (8 total).**
  Ranked the whole csl-orig corpus by `<ls>` richness and tagged the leaders:
  **AP** (Apte), **AP90**, **PW**, **BEN** (Benfey), **SCH** (Schmidt), **BHS**
  (Edgerton). New [src/renou_sigla.py](src/renou_sigla.py) holds the curated
  Apte/Benfey siglum→state tables (Apte `R`=Raghuvaṃśa, `Mv`=Mahāvīracarita — *not*
  Rāmāyaṇa/Mahāvastu) and the BHS rule (**default-V** + a meta blocklist of
  editors/dictionaries); [src/tag_dict_from_source.py](src/tag_dict_from_source.py)
  generalises the MW tagger over any dict (Petersburg dicts PW/SCH **reuse the PWG
  map**; AP/AP90/BEN use the inline tables; BHS the default-V rule) and emits
  `{code}_renou.jsonl` (gitignored). **360 366 more entries tagged:**
  - **BHS** 17 839 — 73.8 % `<ls>`-tagged, **all V** (13 172; the pure Buddhist
    signal: *dharma/buddha/bodhisattva* `ls=[V]`, corroborated by DCS).
  - **BEN** 17 310 — 70.0 % `<ls>` (citations concentrate in ~30 sigla).
  - **AP** 90 654 / **AP90** 34 882 — 26–29 % `<ls>` (long Apte siglum tail), DCS V
    4 774 / 3 646.
  - **PW** 170 556 / **SCH** 29 125 — `<ls>` partial (10–13 %; their Petersburg sigla
    exceed the PWG canon), but DCS carries them (PW enriched V = 10 340).
  Together with PWG + MW, all eight LS-rich dictionaries now carry the two-layer,
  provenance-tagged Renou state, keyed by `key1`.

### Fixed
- `nws_split.py` OWNER citation now stops at `;` so the trailing-tag
  sub-entry variant (`gloss … <DIATAG> ; SOURCE:page`, e.g. `aYj`) keeps
  only the SOURCE as owner, not the diasystem tag.
- `nws_split.py check` locates card rows on word boundaries instead of raw
  substring, killing a false MISATTRIBUTION where the short Sanskrit
  locator `apāṃ` matched inside the compounds `apāṃpitta`/`apāṃnidhi`
  (the `ap` cross-reference `apāṃ napāt → s.v. napāt` has no card row).
- **Root cause of the `av` `+ upa` owner slide:** `compile_translatable`
  `mask_nws_gloss` now strips the leading owner *bleed*. A roman-numeral
  co-owner cite (`Rivelex (2) : XLV`) that `nws_split`'s digit-only OWNER
  can't tag rode onto the FRONT of the next gloss as `<tag> ; Source :
  page > …`, putting a competing source in the to-translate prose of
  glosses whose deterministic owner was already correct — which led the
  LLM assembly to attribute `+ upa` to Rivelex instead of Geldner. The
  strip fires only on real bleeds (5 `av` glosses) and leaves
  `nws_split.py` itself untouched (parsing the roman co-owner there
  destabilises lemma/gloss alignment).
- Hand-corrected the slid `av` `+ upa` block in the (gitignored) merged
  card to the reading-direction owners (Geldner → Graßmann → NṚV → NṚV →
  Rivelex); all other prefix blocks verified already-correct.

- `nws_split.py` OWNER trailing parenthetical now spans one level of
  nested parens and no longer requires the `s.v.` prefix, so cites like
  `BHSD : 154 (s.v. ekoti -(° tī -) bhūta)`,
  `Olivelle 2015 : 391 (s.v. ṣaḍvidha (- bala))` and bare headword
  variants `MW : 756 (bhā́s)` / `MW : 759 (bhujiṣyà)` resolve their owner
  instead of being dropped. Found by the b-section split-preview audit;
  `selftest` + all 10 a-section checks still CLEAN.
- `scale_route.py` accepts any single-letter section (e.g. `b`), not just
  `a`/`all`, emitting `scale_manifest.<letter>.json`.
- **`nws_split.nws_fragment` no longer swallows the appended owner map.**
  `_pilot_gen_merged.py` writes an authoritative `NWS — PRE-PARSED OWNER
  MAP` layer after the net-new NWS addendum, but `nws_fragment` captured
  `(.*)\Z` from the first `=== LAYER: NWS` marker to EOF, so on any
  owner-map input it re-parsed that map as source content — corrupting
  `split()`, the F12 gate (`check`) and `compile_translatable` (the
  d-section first showed 1,380 phantom empty-gloss + 33 phantom no-owner
  entries). It now captures only up to the next `=== LAYER:` marker and
  skips the `PRE-PARSED` header. Found while auditing the d-section (first
  section generated with the owner-map injection); `selftest` + all 10
  a-section checks still CLEAN, `compile_translatable('day')` → 7 clean
  units, 0 map artifacts.
- **`nws_owner_map` debleeds the injected owner map.** The roman co-owner
  bleed (e.g. `Hillebrandt 1885 : IV`) that `compile_translatable` already
  strips also contaminated the appended `PRE-PARSED OWNER MAP`: `split`'s
  `lemma_tag` scatters the bled segment into an entry's leading gloss, its
  tag (stray `; Name : page`) and a punctuation-only lemma (`{#,#}`). The
  owner stays correct, so this is cosmetic for what the translator reads.
  `nws_owner_map` now strips the leading-bleed from the gloss, removes a
  bled-in `Name : page` cite from the tag, and drops punct-only lemmas
  (mirrors `mask_nws_gloss`). The owner field is never touched; clean
  sections are no-ops. Found in the g-section (`gam`).

### Added
- `run_real_test.py audit` is now a true **NWS attribution gate**: a fresh
  (non-protected) card whose NWS owners disagree with the deterministic
  `nws_split` parse is rejected — its `<safe>.merged.md` is moved to
  `<safe>.merged.REJECTED.md` so the next `prep` re-queues it — and the
  command exits non-zero. Protected hand-authored cards are audited but
  never quarantined. Verified end-to-end (slid card → FAIL → quarantined →
  exit 1; clean card → PASS → exit 0). `selftest` + all 10 audited keys
  CLEAN.

### Audited
- **Full b-section deterministic split-preview** (all 4,613 b-keys → 971
  NWS-bearing, 2,655 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds** — the `av`-class
  F12 owner slide does not occur anywhere in the b-section. After the
  trailer-paren fix above, only 11 entries are unowned: 4 benign
  empty-segments + 7 real losses confined to the two known-limitation
  sources below.
- **Full c-section deterministic split-preview** (all 2,366 c-keys → 719
  NWS-bearing, 1,828 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 17 unowned = 8
  benign empty-segments + 9 real losses, all in the known-limitation
  sources below (8 × Meister `(2.1)`, 1 × Böhtlingk `*NNN`).
- **Full d-section deterministic split-preview** (all 6,019 d-keys → 1,439
  NWS-bearing, 3,808 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. First section
  generated with the owner-map injection, which surfaced the
  `nws_fragment` over-capture bug fixed above; after that fix only 4
  entries (0.10%) are real losses — one each Meister `(2.1)`, roman page,
  Böhtlingk `*NNN`, plus one page-less cross-reference
  (`duHzvapnya → s.v. duṣvápnya (Graßmann 1873 (1996))`, no `: page` to
  parse). The 14 remaining unowned are benign empty terminal segments.
- **Full e-section deterministic split-preview** (all 663 e-keys → 203
  NWS-bearing, 470 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**, cleanest section so
  far. 3 unowned = 2 benign empty + 1 page-less cross-reference
  (`eta → s.v. éta . Rivelex (2) (s.v. éta)`, no `: page` to parse); none
  of the Meister/roman/Böhtlingk classes appear. Cross-checked against the
  injected owner map: 470 map entries with exactly 3 `[NWS: ?]`, matching
  the split-preview one-for-one — confirming the `nws_fragment` fix and
  owner-map generation are consistent. The page-less cross-reference (no
  `Name : page` cite exists) is a recurring benign category, not a parser
  gap — it also appears once in d (`duHzvapnya`).
- **Full f-section deterministic split-preview** (all 339 f-keys [SLP1 `f`
  = ṛ] → 156 NWS-bearing, 502 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds, 0 real
  losses** — the only unowned entry is a benign empty terminal segment, no
  Meister/roman/Böhtlingk/page-less cases. Owner-map cross-check: 502 map
  entries, exactly 1 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one.
- **Full g-section deterministic split-preview** (all 3,354 g-keys → 974
  NWS-bearing, 2,866 entries): **2 roman-cite bleeds** (both `gam`,
  `Hillebrandt 1885 : IV`) — the first bleeds since the a-section; the
  owner stays correct (`Geldner 1907 : 52`), and the cosmetic owner-map
  contamination is fixed by the `nws_owner_map` debleed above. 9 unowned =
  8 benign empty + 1 Meister `(2.1)` (0.03% real loss). Owner-map
  cross-check: 2,866 entries, 9 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview.
- **Full h-section deterministic split-preview** (all 2,027 h-keys → 466
  NWS-bearing, 1,353 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 10 unowned = 8
  benign empty + 2 real (1 Meister `(2.1)`, 1 page-less cross-reference
  `hriRIy → s.v. hṛṇīy (TŚPC 3)`, no `: page`) = 0.15%. Owner-map
  cross-check: 1,353 entries, 10 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview,
  and **0 inputs with residual contamination** — confirming the
  `nws_owner_map` debleed produces clean maps on fresh generation.
- **Full i-section deterministic split-preview** (all 777 i-keys → 281
  NWS-bearing, 1,045 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 4 unowned = 3
  benign empty + 1 real (`in → … : XLVII (als Lemma in Rivelex 1, S. 561
  hinzuzufügen)`, a roman-page owner trailed by an editorial note — the
  roman-page known limitation) = 0.10%. Owner-map cross-check: 1,045
  entries, 4 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview, 0 residual
  contamination.
- **Full j-section deterministic split-preview** (all 2,089 j-keys → 506
  NWS-bearing, 1,207 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds, 0 real losses** — the
  6 unowned entries are all benign empty terminal segments, with no
  Meister/roman/Böhtlingk/page-less cases (0.00% real loss). Owner-map
  cross-check: 1,207 entries, exactly 6 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the
  split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full k-section deterministic split-preview** (all 8,637 k-keys → 2,590
  NWS-bearing, 6,530 entries — the largest section): **3 roman-cite
  bleeds** (all `kar`, `Hillebrandt 1885 : IV`, the same g-section pattern;
  owner stays correct and the cosmetic owner-map contamination is cleaned
  by the `nws_owner_map` debleed — **0 residual contamination**). 39 unowned
  = 28 benign empty + 11 real (0.17%): 6 × Meister `(2.1)`, 2 page-less
  x-ref, 1 roman page, 1 Böhtlingk `*NNN`, all known limitations, plus **1
  source-data typo** — `vṛtrakhādá → … NṚV 2B : 79 (s. (2. khād )` has an
  **unbalanced** trailing parenthetical (a stray extra `(`, a digitization
  error for `(s.v. 2. khād )`); its two sibling entries with the identical
  owner `NṚV 2B : 79` (`amitrakhādá`, `vikhādá`) parse correctly, so this is
  bad input, not a parser gap — admitting unbalanced parens is the kind of
  destabilising relaxation already reverted, so no code change. Owner-map
  cross-check: 6,530 entries, 39 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview
  one-for-one.
- **Full l-section deterministic split-preview** (all 1,464 l-keys → 286
  NWS-bearing, 735 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 11 unowned = 6 benign
  empty + 5 real (0.68%), all known limitations: 4 × Böhtlingk `*NNN` + 1
  page-less x-ref; no Meister/roman/OTHER cases. The 0.68% real-loss rate is
  the highest section so far only because the small 735-entry base magnifies
  one `*NNN` cluster — not a new gap. Owner-map cross-check: 735 entries, 11
  `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual
  contamination.
- **Full m-section deterministic split-preview** (all 6,350 m-keys → 1,425
  NWS-bearing, 3,495 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 28 unowned = 17 benign
  empty + 11 real (0.31%), all known limitations: 6 × Meister `(2.1)` + 4 ×
  roman page + 1 page-less x-ref; no Böhtlingk `*NNN`/OTHER cases. Owner-map
  cross-check: 3,495 entries, 28 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview
  one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full n-section deterministic split-preview** (all 4,278 n-keys → 1,022
  NWS-bearing, 2,407 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 27 unowned = 24 benign
  empty + 3 real (0.12%), all known limitations: 2 × page-less x-ref + 1 ×
  roman page; no Meister `(2.1)`/Böhtlingk `*NNN`/OTHER cases. Owner-map
  cross-check: 2,407 entries, 27 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview
  one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full o-section deterministic split-preview** (all 461 o-keys → 129
  NWS-bearing, 306 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**, **0 unowned** — the
  cleanest section so far (0.00% real loss; no benign empties, no known-
  limitation classes, no OTHER). Owner-map cross-check: 306 entries, 0
  `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full p-section deterministic split-preview** (all 11,095 p-keys → 2,878
  NWS-bearing, 6,863 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 90 unowned = 73 benign
  empty + 17 real (0.25%): 8 × page-less x-ref + 6 × Meister `(2.1)` + 2 ×
  roman page + **1 new known-limitation class** — a multi-page citation
  (`TPSI 3 : 19, 22` on `prakaraRasama`). The fragment's terminal owner closes
  with a comma-joined page list, which OWNER's single-token page class
  (`\d+[A-Za-z]?`) cannot represent, so the owner does not close the gloss and
  is dropped — structurally the same digit-only-page cause as the roman/
  asterisk-page limitations (single TPSI multi-page cite in the section; not a
  typo, not a bug). Owner-map cross-check: 6,863 entries, 90 `[NWS: ?]`,
  matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full q-section deterministic split-preview** (all 105 q-keys [SLP1 `q` =
  retroflex ḍ] → 18 NWS-bearing, 42 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 2
  unowned = 1 benign empty + 1 real, a single Meister `(2.1)`; no OTHER. The
  2.38% real-loss rate is purely the 42-entry small base magnifying one
  Meister cite, not a new gap. Owner-map cross-check: 42 entries, 2
  `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full r-section deterministic split-preview** (all 2,905 r-keys → 656
  NWS-bearing, 1,770 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 9 unowned = 8 benign
  empty + 1 real (0.06%), the multi-page-cite known limitation again
  (`Ensink 1964 : 156, viii` on `ratnasaMBava` — a comma-joined page list, the
  second token a lowercase roman; single page `Ensink 1964 : 156` parses, the
  `, viii` breaks the close). No Meister/Böhtlingk/roman/OTHER cases. Owner-map
  cross-check: 1,770 entries, 9 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview
  one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full s-section deterministic split-preview** (all 18,140 s-keys → 4,297
  NWS-bearing, 10,588 entries — the largest section): **0 roman-cite bleeds**.
  88 unowned = 73 benign empty + 15 real (0.14%): 6 × Meister `(2.1)` + 3 ×
  multi-page cite (`TPSI 3 : 235, 238`, `213, 216`, `248, 249, 251`) + 3 ×
  page-less x-ref (incl. `śelu → Olivelle 2013 : śelu (s.v. śleṣmātaka )`, a
  word locator, no numeric page) + 2 × roman page + **1 new known-limitation
  class** — a lowercase parenthetical source name (`succhardís → s.v. suchardís
  Graßmann 1873 (1996). (pw) : 1531`). OWNER's name class is capital-initial, so
  `(pw)` is not matched (the canonical `PW : 1531` parses); it is a rare,
  well-formed citation style, not a typo. Owner-map cross-check: 10,588 entries,
  88 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual
  contamination.
- **Full t-section deterministic split-preview** (all 3,477 t-keys → 821
  NWS-bearing, 1,968 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 15 unowned = 12 benign
  empty + 3 real (0.15%): 1 × Meister `(2.1)` + 1 × roman page + 1 × multi-page
  cite (`taTAgata → Ensink 1964 : 73, vii`, comma-joined page list, as in
  r/s). No new classes, no OTHER left after classification. Owner-map
  cross-check: 1,968 entries, 15 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview
  one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full u-section deterministic split-preview** (all 2,903 u-keys → 1,126
  NWS-bearing, 2,656 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 39 unowned = 34 benign
  empty + 5 real (0.19%): 2 × page-less x-ref + 2 × Meister `(2.1)` + 1 ×
  roman page; no new classes, no OTHER. Owner-map cross-check: 2,656 entries,
  39 `[NWS: ?]`, matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual
  contamination.
- **Full v-section deterministic split-preview** (all 9,658 v-keys → 2,418
  NWS-bearing, 6,526 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 79 unowned = 65 benign
  empty + 14 real (0.21%): 8 × Meister `(2.1)` + 2 × page-less x-ref + 2 ×
  roman page + 1 × multi-page cite (`vErocana → Ensink 1964 : 180, viii`) + 1 ×
  source-data typo (`vftraKAda` = vṛtrakhāda → `NṚV 2B : 79 (s. (2. khād )`).
  The typo is the **same upstream NWS defect** already in the errata (an
  unbalanced trailing paren); it surfaces here under the v-keyed headword and
  in the k-section under the khād-root fragment (`KAd`), so it costs an owner
  in both section-fragments — one source defect, two losses. No new classes,
  both OTHER classified. Owner-map cross-check: 6,526 entries, 79 `[NWS: ?]`,
  matching the split-preview one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full w-section deterministic split-preview** (all 92 w-keys [SLP1 `w` =
  retroflex ṭ] → 19 NWS-bearing, 45 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**, **0
  real** (1 benign empty), 0 OTHER. Owner-map cross-check: 45 entries, 1
  `[NWS: ?]`, one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full x-section deterministic split-preview** (all 3 x-keys [SLP1 `x` =
  vocalic ḷ] → 2 NWS-bearing, 9 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**, **0
  unowned**, 0 OTHER — the smallest section. Owner-map cross-check: 9 entries,
  0 `[NWS: ?]`, one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full y-section deterministic split-preview** (all 1,810 y-keys → 420
  NWS-bearing, 1,286 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 3 unowned = 1 benign
  empty + 2 real (0.16%): 1 × roman page + 1 × Böhtlingk `*NNN`; no new
  classes, no OTHER. Owner-map cross-check: 1,286 entries, 3 `[NWS: ?]`,
  one-for-one, 0 residual contamination.
- **Full z-section deterministic split-preview** (all 302 z-keys [SLP1 `z` =
  ṣ] → 64 NWS-bearing, 112 entries): **0 roman-cite bleeds**. 2 unowned = 1
  benign empty + 1 real, a single Böhtlingk `*NNN`; no OTHER. The 0.89%
  real-loss rate is the 112-entry small base magnifying one cite, not a new
  gap. Owner-map cross-check: 112 entries, 2 `[NWS: ?]`, one-for-one, 0
  residual contamination. **This completes the full SLP1 key universe (a–z,
  with capital/long-vowel sections folded into their lowercase counterparts by
  the case-insensitive section router).**

### Known limitations
- **`Meister 1988 (2.1) : 397`** — a source name carrying a `.` *inside* a
  parenthetical volume number (`(2.1)`) is not recognized as an owner,
  because OWNER's name class excludes `.` on purpose (to stop names like
  `Hoernle 1893-1912 (II) 30.81` / `EI Vol. XV` from swallowing whole
  sentences — guarded by the `aMSa` selftest). Drops 4 b-section owners
  (`BadrapIWa`, `boDimaRqa`, `BadraraTa`, `BUmiKaRqa`).
- **`Walter 1893 : XXXII`** — a roman-numeral page is not matched, because
  OWNER's page is digit-only. Admitting roman pages globally is what
  destabilised the parser earlier (it turns co-owner segments into
  gloss-closers → lemma-stuffing) and was reverted, so it stays out.
  Drops 3 b-section owners (`brahmagranTi`, `brahmaranDra`, `brahmadvAra`).
- **`Böhtlingk 1887 : *163`** — an asterisk-prefixed page is not matched,
  because OWNER's page is digit-only. Extending it to `\*?\d+` was tried
  and reverted: like roman pages, admitting `*NNN` turns segments such as
  `Böhtlingk 1887 : *150 >` into gloss-closers and regressed `ap`/`av` to
  MISATTRIBUTION. Drops 1 c-section owner (`ci`).
- **`TPSI 3 : 19, 22`** — a multi-page citation (comma-joined page list) is
  not matched, because OWNER's page is a single token (`\d+[A-Za-z]?`) and the
  owner must close the gloss; the trailing `, 22` leaves residue after `: 19`,
  so the owner does not close and is dropped entirely. Same digit-only-page
  family as roman/asterisk pages: broadening the page class to swallow
  comma-joined lists would let trailing comma-separated gloss content be read
  as page numbers, destabilising segment/owner alignment, so it stays out by
  design. Drops `prakaraRasama` (p), `ratnasaMBava` (r,
  `Ensink 1964 : 156, viii`), 3 s-section owners (`savyaBicAra`,
  `saMSayasama`, `sADyasama`, all `TPSI 3 : …, …`), `taTAgata` (t,
  `Ensink 1964 : 73, vii`) and `vErocana` (v, `Ensink 1964 : 180, viii`).
- **`(pw) : 1531`** — a lowercase parenthetical source name is not matched,
  because OWNER's name class is capital-initial (the canonical `PW : 1531`
  parses); admitting lowercase parenthetical tokens would let parenthetical
  gloss asides be read as owners, so it stays out by the same name-class design
  as `Meister (2.1)`. Drops 1 s-section owner (`sucCardis → s.v. suchardís
  Graßmann 1873 (1996). (pw) : 1531`); a rare, well-formed citation style, not
  a typo.
- These are rare (b: 7 / 2,655 = 0.26%; c: 9 / 1,828 = 0.49%), terminal,
  and confined to a few works (Meister 1988, Walter 1893, Böhtlingk 1887);
  the safely-fixable nested/variant-paren gap is already fixed. Roman and
  asterisk pages share one cause — admitting them as page tokens
  destabilises segment/owner alignment — so both stay out by design.

### Added
- `schemas/pwg_ru_final_card.schema.json` and
  `validate_final_card_schema.py` define the final translated-card + judge
  contract, including auditable Apresjan `differentia` evidence.
- `validate_assembled_export.py` checks deterministic assembled-card JSONL
  exports, with full count-match mode and bounded supervised-sample mode.
- `run_batch.py validate_review` and `run_batch.py apply_review` make the
  review store gate machine-checkable before any row can become print-ready.
- `gold_validate.py`, `gold_ingest.py`, and `gold_agreement.py` validate human
  gold labels, ingest release-bound JSONL, and compute Wilson precision plus
  double-review agreement metrics.
- `export_interop.py` and `validate_interop.py` generate and validate minimal
  TEI Lex-0, OntoLex, and Russian reverse-index artifacts.
- `make_edition_cut.py`, `validate_release.py`, `CITATION.cff`, and
  `DOI_PLAN.md` add the immutable edition-cut skeleton and manifest hash check.
- Nonhuman print-gate helper tooling now prepares reviewer work without filling
  human decisions: `run_batch.py review_report`, `gold_status.py`,
  `gold_packet.py`, `gold_double_review_queue.py`, and `release_readiness.py`.
- `gold/REVIEWER_HANDOFF.md` gives reviewers one place for allowed enum values,
  protected columns, validation commands, and the G5-G7 handoff flow.
- `gold_packet_verify.py`, `gold_double_review_verify.py`, and
  `preflight_remaining_gates.py` verify reviewer packets, second-review queues,
  and the compact "what's left?" status without inferring any human labels.
- `gold_ingest_double_review.py` bridges filled wide double-review queues into
  long-form reviewer JSONL that `gold_agreement.py` can score.
- Review-gate fixture coverage now exercises blank decisions, invalid approvals,
  explicit `apply_review`, and fail-closed interop export without touching the
  real local translation store.

### Changed
- `assemble.py build` now writes to temp files and installs outputs only after
  successful completion, protecting `assembled_cards.jsonl` from killed-run
  corruption.
- Failed atomic replacement now leaves the previous assembled export untouched
  and keeps the temp file for manual recovery instead of unlinking the old file.
- `assemble.py build` now precomputes corpus evidence once per build, uses
  `corpus_lexicon.jsonl` rows for export-time examples instead of per-card
  SQLite FTS, and supports grouped-card chunks via `--offset`, `--out`, and
  `--quarantine`.
- The top-level AI/release status now says the core release machinery is ready
  but print remains blocked by human review, human gold labels, double-review
  agreement, and a real immutable edition cut.
- `roadmap_check.py` now detects gate status drift between the aggregate
  scientific-hardening JSON and the JSONL gate ledger.
- Release manifest validation now rejects missing/null gate status maps and
  checks manifest gate statuses against the edition's copied gate ledger.
- The monorepo CI/local fixture checks now exercise final-card schemas,
  gold-label packets, double-review queues, interop fixture exports, and a
  fixture edition cut without requiring local gitignored production data.
- `run_batch.py` and `release_readiness.py` accept `PWG_RU_STORE`,
  `PWG_RU_REVIEW_Q`, `PWG_RU_REVIEW_CSV`, and `PWG_RU_REVIEW_REPORT` path
  overrides so review-gate tests can run against disposable fixture stores.
- Full interop export now validates: `release/tei_lex0.xml` and
  `release/ontolex.ttl` each cover 120,173 lexical entries, and
  `release/reverse_index.jsonl` has 209,319 Russian-to-Sanskrit rows.

## 2026-06-19

### Added
- Machine-readable scientific-hardening roadmap and print-blocking quality gates:
  `roadmap/scientific_hardening.json`, `roadmap/quality_gates.jsonl`, and
  `src/roadmap_check.py`.
- `src/pilot/run_real_test.py` audit preflight was exercised with a synthetic
  `ap` workflow output, proving the collect → protected-card preservation →
  `nws_split.py check` → report path before the June-22 Max run.
- `run_batch.py review_csv` exports `_review_queue.jsonl` to a spreadsheet-ready
  `_review_queue.csv` with blank human-review columns (`reviewer_id`, `decision`,
  `edit`, `notes`) while leaving review state unchanged.
- `gold/HUMAN_GOLD_PROTOCOL.md` defines the human gold-set labeling protocol,
  double-review/adjudication workflow, and acceptance criteria; `gold_review_csv.py`
  exports the existing 320-row balanced scaffold for reviewers.
- `schemas/pwg_ru_lexicographic_portrait.schema.json` and
  `validate_portrait_schema.py` define and check the v1 Apresjan portrait
  contract for live `microstructure.portrait()` output.

### Changed
- Modern Sanskrit-Russian sources with project approvals are now marked
  publishable with attribution/provenance, not evidence-only; see
  [RIGHTS_APPROVALS.md](RIGHTS_APPROVALS.md).
- Shared the case-collision-safe filename encoder across NWS scrape/split/audit,
  pilot generation, and merge lookup; forbidden Windows filename characters are
  escaped reversibly.
- `_pilot_collect.py` now writes audited `<safe>.merged.md` files directly using
  `safe_name()`; the real-test auditor no longer needs a brittle external
  `<key>.md` copy bridge and uses the same filename encoder as the rest of the
  pipeline.
- `run_real_test.py prep` was refreshed for the June-22 batch window
  (`OFFSET=0`, `LIMIT=10`): `as As Ap api amfta agni Atman anu arjuna arTa`,
  now correctly all fresh after exact-case output checks.
- `run_pilot_wf.js` now loads the canonical final-card schema instead of
  carrying a prompt-local schema copy.

### Fixed
- Corpus harvest no longer lemmatizes Sanskrit proper names such as `Агни` to
  unrelated Russian verbs such as `агнуть`.
- `scale_route.py` now routes by the protected microstructure sense parser.
- `assemble.py` quarantines lossy round-trip records instead of emitting them
  into the normal assembled card stream.
- `run_batch.py migrate_legacy` backfills old translation-store rows and marks
  unverifiable legacy cards `legacy_needs_review`.
- Protected hand-authored pilot cards (`aMSa`, `anna`, `ap`) are preserved during
  real-test collection/audit, while still being audited by `nws_split.py`.
- Legacy `.merged.md` compatibility checks now require exact filenames, avoiding
  Windows case-insensitive false positives such as `Ap` being treated as protected
  because `ap.merged.md` exists.
- Generated the missing writable a-section input for `arI|a` (`|` escaped as
  `~007c`); pilot inputs now cover 12,156/12,156 a-section manifest cards.
- Materialized the human review worklist with `run_batch.py review`: 217
  `legacy_needs_review` cards, severity-sorted, with no reviewer decisions
  advanced.

## 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Corpus harvest layer** ([HARVEST.md](HARVEST.md)): `build_ls_map.py` +
  `ls_source_map.json` (PWG `<ls>`→stratum, 45 sources = 72.4% of 772k
  citations, 29.8% corpus-harvestable) and `corpus_harvest.py` — SLP1 key →
  Russian renderings, lemma-grouped (pymorphy3), POS-filtered, stratified, with
  the `<ls>`-cited stratum first and a `--raw` escape for particle headwords.
- **Recurring deterministic integrity auditor** (`_audit.py`): flags
  placeholder leak / non-Cyrillic / `ru==sa` / `√`-keys / dups / stratum
  mismatch; run at each build milestone; exit-code verdict.
- **Live cost/ETA watcher** (`_watch.py`): progress bar, $ spent / needed, ETA,
  measured over a live window (not the append-only file's stale ctime).
- **Methodology review** ([METHODOLOGY_REVIEW.md](METHODOLOGY_REVIEW.md)):
  grounded 5-lens review (FAIR/DH, bilingual lexicography, corpus-NLP eval,
  standards/interop, editorial) → prioritized roadmap.
- **Priority-1 fixes**: per-card **provenance** (model ids, prompt hash,
  `pwg.txt` commit, run id, timestamp + persisted senses); **human-review state
  machine** + `run_batch.py review` editor worklist; **per-sense rights gate**
  (`corpus_gate.RIGHTS`/`publishable()`) + **CC BY-SA 4.0** data licence
  ([DATA_LICENSE.md](DATA_LICENSE.md)).
- **Coverage honesty check** (`corpus_harvest.py coverage`): per-stratum rows /
  groups-done flags EMPTY/thin strata.
- **Apresjan theoretical grounding** ([APRESJAN.md](APRESJAN.md)) and a
  **failure gallery** ([failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md](failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md)).

### Changed
- Corpus-lexicon build **batched** (~8 verse-units / DeepSeek call, 12 workers,
  biggest-first); quality verified equal to single-call, ~3–4× faster.
- `build_strata.count_groups()` now requires a Cyrillic translation, so sizes /
  ordering reflect genuinely-translated material (78,139 → 58,897 genuine groups).

### Fixed
- **Placeholder fabrication (build-stopping)**: untranslated `…` verses were fed
  to DeepSeek, which hallucinated 166k/204k rows (81%). Fixed with a Cyrillic
  guard; recovered to 26,277 genuine rows. See the gallery.
- Footnote-overwrites-translation; `√` leaking into keys; commentary
  cross-segment duplication; biggest-first cost mis-projection; frozen/dead-build
  liveness misreads. See [failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md](failures/FAILURE_GALLERY.md).

## 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Source extraction** (`build_src.py`): 5 Sanskrit–Russian dictionaries
  (Кочергина, Кнауэр, Фриш, Смирнов, Коссович) pulled from SamudraManthanam →
  gitignored `src/*.jsonl` (~57,640 keyed entries).
- **Stage-4 corpus gate** (`corpus_gate.py`): SLP1 join over the 5 dicts + the
  parallel-corpus query; non-blocking 2-signal annotation (correctness vs
  independent dicts; reference-agreement vs KOW). Coverage measured honestly
  (correctness 16.4% / KOW 8.0% / corpus ~14–15%; dominant `no-check`).
- **Pipeline** (`pwg_mask.py` masker, `assemble.py` harvest, `run_batch.py`
  driver): mask German skeleton → harvest attested senses → translate (Sonnet
  4.6 on Max) → judge (Opus 4.8) → re-translate. Pilot: 6/6 then ~88–95%
  first-pass publishable.
- **Stratification** (`build_strata.py` + `corpus_strata.json`): 121 corpus
  texts by genre (Renou) + date (Dharmamitra Gibbs median + 95% CI) + period.

### Changed
- Strategy pivots: **harvest-first** (assemble Russian from existing material;
  harvested meanings become additional *attested senses*), then **corpus-first**
  (build the corpus word-alignment lexicon before bulk translation), then
  **quality-over-quantity** (it becomes a printed scholarly dictionary).

## 2026-06-14

### Added
- **pwg_ru kit scaffolded** (committed `384fedb`), mirroring the completed
  `mw_ru`: editor doc [pwg_ru.md](pwg_ru.md) + stage prompts
  ([pwg_ru_prompts/](pwg_ru_prompts/)) (translate → 2 QA judges → re-translate →
  corpus check). Headline format rule: PWG `{%…%}` wraps both German glosses
  (translate) and Latin (leave). Model unified to Opus 4.8.
