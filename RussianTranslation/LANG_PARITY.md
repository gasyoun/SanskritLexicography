# LANG_PARITY.md — cross-language fix/feature parity ledger

_Created: 04-07-2026 · Last updated: 04-07-2026_

This repo runs the same PWG→Russian and PWG→English translation pipeline through
shared tooling (`src/pilot/gen_opt_harness2.py`, `src/pilot/translation_memory.py`,
`src/pilot/audit_window*.py`, …), parameterized by `--lang`. History shows fixes
land on one language path and quietly never reach the other — e.g. 3 gate-bug
fixes shipped 2026-07-03 (multi-layer sense over-count, German/Latin/French
misclassification guards, Sanskrit-span gloss-leak scrub) live only in the RU
audit path; `audit_window_en.py` reimplements its own gates from scratch and
never got them. A separate audit on 2026-07-04 also found `requeue_from_audit.py`
silently dropping the mandatory `--no-tm` flag on **both** paths at once.

## Policy (binding — read before closing out any fix/feature session)

1. **Same-session obligation.** Any session that fixes a bug or adds a mechanism
   on ONE language path must, before calling the work done, classify it as one
   of:
   - **SHARED** — the fix lives in lang-parameterized code and already applies
     to every language. Port it now if it doesn't.
   - **INTENTIONAL-DIVERGENCE** — the languages genuinely need different
     behavior. Write the one-line **why** in this ledger (a missing rationale
     is itself a defect, not a shortcut).
   - **GAP** — it should eventually apply everywhere but isn't ported yet.
     Record it here AND spawn a tracked follow-up (a task chip, handoff, or
     GTD row) — a GAP entry with no tracking reference is not allowed to sit
     silently.
2. **No silent single-language fixes.** Landing a fix only on RU (or only on
   EN, or only on a future 3rd language) without one of the three verdicts
   above is a process defect, not a style choice.
3. **Structure is per-language, not RU/EN-hardcoded**, so adding a 3rd
   language later is a new `languages` entry in the ledger below, not a
   doc rewrite.
4. **Mechanical enforcement.** [`src/pilot/lang_parity_check.py`](src/pilot/lang_parity_check.py)
   parses the ledger block below and is wired into
   [`window_selftest.py`](src/pilot/window_selftest.py) as
   `test_lang_parity_ledger_complete`. It fails the suite when:
   - a ledger entry has no verdict, or an `INTENTIONAL-DIVERGENCE` entry has
     no `note`, or a `GAP` entry has no `tracking` reference;
   - a file referenced by an entry has changed (sha256 drift) since the entry
     was last verified — this is a proxy for "someone touched parity-tracked
     code and didn't re-affirm parity still holds." Re-run
     `python src/pilot/lang_parity_check.py --update-hash <entry_id>` after
     confirming the change doesn't break the recorded verdict, and update
     `note`/`tracking` if it does.
   It does **not** attempt deep semantic diffing (no AST/behavior comparison)
   — it is a forcing function to make a human/session re-affirm the verdict,
   not a replacement for actually reading the diff.

## Ledger

Machine-readable block below (JSON, not YAML, to avoid an extra dependency in
`lang_parity_check.py`). Each entry:

```
id            stable slug, never reused/renumbered
mechanism     one-line human description
files         file paths this entry tracks for drift (relative to RussianTranslation/)
languages     languages this entry currently covers (["ru","en"], or the subset that's SHARED)
verdict       SHARED | INTENTIONAL-DIVERGENCE | GAP
note          required for INTENTIONAL-DIVERGENCE: the one-line why
tracking      required for GAP: task id / handoff / PR reference
verified_sha256   {file: hex} snapshot at last verification; drift trips the gate
```

## When a 3rd language is proposed

Add its files/verdicts as new ledger entries (or extend `languages` arrays on
existing SHARED entries once verified) — do not restructure the JSON shape.
If the 3rd language needs its own audit script (as EN did), immediately add a
`GAP` row for every RU-only fix in the ledger above rather than discovering
the gap months later.
